### The difference between a Mushrik and hypocrite
###### Fatwa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah wal-Ifta' no. 19219

#### Question: 
What is the difference between a Mushrik and a hypocrite?
#### Answer: 
A Mushrik is someone who devotes any of ‘Ibadah (worship) to other than Allah and does this publicly, such as the grave-worshippers and their like. This is Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), which leaves nothing of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) to its committer, and this is the Mushrik to whom Allah has forbidden Jannah (Paradise) and made Hellfire their final abode. Allah shall never forgive them their Shirk if they die persisting in it, without having performed Tawbah (repentance to Allah) of it, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: "Verily, Allâh forgives not that partners should be set up with Him (in worship), but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He wills; and whoever sets up partners with Allâh in worship, he has indeed invented a tremendous sin." [an-Nisa: 48]

Allah (Exalted be He) also says: "Verily, whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with Allâh, then Allâh has forbidden Paradise to him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers) there are no helpers." [al-Maidah: 72]

As for a hypocrite who practices hypocrisy in their faith, this is someone who outwardly shows Islam but inwardly hides Kufr (disbelief), such as those who belie or detest the Messenger (peace be upon him), belie or detest his Message, or feel happy when they see the Din (religion) waning and hate to see it victorious and similar ill feelings. Such a hypocrite will abide in Hell forever, in the lowest depth of the Fire, if they die persisting in this hypocrisy, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: "Verily, the hypocrites will be in the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no helper will you find for them." [an-Nisa: 145]
