# Lines attributed to Al-Jilani

Question: 
The said Imam says that the following verses are attributed to 'Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani: "**I am 'Abdul-Qadir and the land of Allah is in my hands as are the birds; Every Servant circumambulates the Ka`bah for seven rounds but I circumambulate it in my own tents**"  What is meant by "the land of Allah is in my hands as are the birds"? What is the meaning of "but I circumambulate it in my own tents"? I want an official circular with your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar) to distribute among the residents of this area, hoping that it will bring them to the truth. We ask Allah to protect you, lead you to the right path, and make you beneficial to Muslims! 

Answer: 
These lines include falsehood and plain Kufr (disbelief). Shaykh `Abdul-Qadir Al-Jilani (may Allah be merciful to him) is innocent of such lines which are falsely attributed to him. May Allah give the one who fabricated these lines and falsely attributed them to the Shaykh their deserved punishment!
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
