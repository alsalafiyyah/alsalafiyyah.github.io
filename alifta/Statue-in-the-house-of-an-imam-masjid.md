### Statue in the house of an Imam Masjid
###### Fatwa al-Lajnah ad-Daimah wal-Ifta' no. 14820

#### Question: 
There is an Imam in our village who leads congregational Salahs (Prayers). This Imam has at his home a statue made of stone which has a face like that of a man. Women visit this statue every Friday and step over it believing that it will make them pregnant. We asked this shaykh to refrain from this practice as it is Haram (prohibited) and tantamount to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). However, he is not convinced of our view. Some of us are convinced that the shaykh is not Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), that he has sound `Aqidah (creed), and that he believes in Allah not in the statue. Others disagree. Please provide us with your beneficial answer based on Qur'an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). Also, if the shaykh mentioned above is not convinced (that he is committing Shirk) even after receiving your answer, will it be valid to perform Salah (Prayer) behind him? It may be worth mentioning that he receives payment from these women who step over the statue.
#### Answer: 
Firstly: It is Haram for people to visit that statue at the home of the Imam to fulfill their needs. Doing so is Shirk that takes its doer out of the fold of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) states, "And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date-stone)." If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything). " [Fatir: 13-14] 

He (Exalted be He) also states, "To Allâh belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth. He creates what He wills. He bestows female (offspring) upon whom He wills, and bestows male (offspring) upon whom He wills." [ash-Shura: 49] 

"And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone): so invoke not anyone along with Allâh." [al-Jinn: 18] 

Moreover, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, "If you beg, beg of Allah Alone; and if you need assistance, supplicate to Allah Alone for help... ."

Secondly: If this Imam does not perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from accepting Shirk and receiving worldly benefit for it, it will not be permissible to pray behind him.
