# Pre-Islamic erroneous practices related to marriage

Question: 
My grandmother visited Makkah Al-Mukarramah and heard there that the barren woman or the unmarried girl has to read Surah (Qur'anic chapter) Al-Ikhlas in Makkah Al-Mukarramah and to incense her house and body and then go to sleep. If this is done, Allah (Exalted be He) will give her children. Likewise, a lady who is seeking a husband will be given the husband she wishes. My married sister is asking whether she could try this out [for children] but she is afraid. Is it correct to do so? I hope your answer would benefit us.  

Answer: 
What is mentioned in the question concerning things that some women do in the hope of giving birth to children or getting married is Batil (null and void). It is a pre-Islamic myth and a Muslim is not permitted to believe in or do this. The Muslim should put his trust in Allah (Exalted be He) and pray to Him. Those who have delayed pregnancy should take the lawful medications prescribed by physicians. Reading Surah Al-Ikhlas or any other Qur'anic Surah is a good act, but it is not for this purpose. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
