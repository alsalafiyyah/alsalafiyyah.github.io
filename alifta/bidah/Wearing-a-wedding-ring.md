# Wearing a wedding ring

Question: 
Is it permissible to wear a wedding ring?

Answer: 
It is not permissible to wear a wedding ring, since it involves mimicking the customs of Kafirs (non-Muslims). This is not the way Muslims announce a marriage, but it is the way of Kafirs who are mimicked by ignorant Muslims of weak Faith. 
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
