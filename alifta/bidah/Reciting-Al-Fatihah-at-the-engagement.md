# Reciting Al-Fatihah at the engagement

Question: 
Is it a Bid'ah (innovation in religion) to recite Surah Al-Fatihah at the time of engagement? Similarly, is it a Bid'ah for a man to present gifts to his fianc√©e on certain occasions; such as on the Days of 'Eid, the middle of Sha`ban, the Day of 'Ashura', and so on?  

Answer: 
Reciting Surah Al-Fatihah at the time of engagement or wedding is a Bid`ah and so is presenting gifts to the bride on certain occasions, especially if they are non-Islamic.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
