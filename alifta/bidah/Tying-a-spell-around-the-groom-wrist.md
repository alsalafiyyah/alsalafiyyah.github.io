# Tying a spell around the groom's wrist

Question: 
In our country, the following practices are conducted in marriage occasions: 
- Upon bidding the bride farewell, her brother shades her head with a Mus-haf (copy of the Qur'an). They claim that this act is not a Bid`ah (innovation in religion) as it involves religious behavior. We disagree with them as we see that the Mus-haf is a book that should be used for worship only.
- On the wedding day, the groom wears an amulet around his wrist called "Al-Imam Al-Damin". This amulet contains some phrases such as "be in Allah's trust" and many others. 

Does this act count as Bid`ah?

Answer: 
The practice they conduct with the bride is baseless in Shari'ah (Islamic law). With regard to the groom wearing an amulet around his wrist, if the amulet contains a Du'a (supplication) to anyone other than Allah, it is considered major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). If it contains texts of the Qur'an and lawful Du`a', it is Haram (prohibited). Wearing amulets, rings and strings with the purpose of warding off evil is prohibited as they are considered a means leading to a kind of Shirk, namely minor Shirk. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Whoever wears an amulet commits an act of shirk.**"(Musnad Ahmad p. 4/156)

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
