# Concluding the marriage contract at zodiac times

Question: 
Here in Yemen, we have a tradition, that if people want to conclude a marriage contract with a groom, they count on zodiac times, or the appropriate time. In which case this hour is either a blessed or a cursed one, depending on the positions of the star according to their `Aqidah (creed), and if they want to take the bride out (of her house), they take her out during a specific hour according to the positions of the stars, for they claim that a star is facing her when she tends to go out. However, if there is a necessity for her to go out at such a time, they would only let her go out from the backdoor (to avoid facing the star), and when she goes to enter the groom's house, they let her enter from the right side. The same applies to a deceased, as when they move them to the grave, they would only take them out from the right side. Please answer us, May Allah reward you well. Is this permissible or not?  

Answer: 
We do not know any origin for this in the purified Shari`ah (Islamic Law), rather it is an act of Bid'ah (innovation in religion) and a Batil (null and void) conviction. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
