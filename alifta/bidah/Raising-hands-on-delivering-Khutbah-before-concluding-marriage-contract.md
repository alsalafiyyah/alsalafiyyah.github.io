# Raising the hands on delivering a Khutbah before concluding a marriage contract

Question: 
Is there any command in Hadith that orders us to lift our hands on delivering a Khutbah (sermon) before concluding a marriage contract?   

Answer: 
It is not permissible to raise one's hands during the Khutbah of concluding the marriage contract because this was not reported in any Hadith. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
