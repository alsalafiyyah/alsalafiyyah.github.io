This letter is from [**Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah ibn Baz**](/biography/binbaz/) to **Chairman of European Islamic Council**, may Allah protect you! As-salamu 'alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah's Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)

An American-Egyptian citizen living in Tucson, Arizona, called [**Rashad Khalifah**](/refutals/warning-against-rashad-khalifas-denial-of-the-sunnah/) who is in charge of a Masjid (mosque), antagonizes Islam, denies the Sunnah, and disparages the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). There has been many reports against him. The following is a summary of them:

1. This man lives in Tucson, Arizona, the United States of America. He holds a PhD in agricultural engineering and thereby is not eligible to perform the duty of calling to Allah (Exalted be He) in the correct manner. He managed to misguide new Muslims to believe in his opinions which he propagates pretentiously and falsely in the name of Islam which he antagonizes by his denial of the Sunnah. He also cooperates with those who equally deny the Prophet's Sunnah by words or deeds such as Muhammad 'Aly Al-Lahory His claim that he discovered the Inimitability of the Qur’an has raised a scientific controversy.
2. During his visit to Libya in 1399 A.H., he was interviewed by radio. Many people listened to his opinions concerning the purified Sunnah. When a university professor asked him, before getting on the plane, about his opinion on the Prophet's (peace be upon him) Hadiths, he said quickly due to the lack of time: "**They are satanic innovations**". Also, related to his sayings which expose his denial of the Sunnah and allegorically interpreting the Qur'an on a whimsical basis is the following:
    1. He denies the stoning of male and female adulterers whether they were Muhsan (someone in a state of fortification against illegal sexual intercourse outside marriage by virtue of valid current or previous marriage) or not on the basis that this was not revealed in the Qur'an.
    2. His continuous and extreme indecency as citing the Hadith, "**Do not take down anything from me except the Qur'an**" to be evidence for the impermissibility of writing down the Hadiths.
    3. He bases his claim that there is no need for the Sunnah or the Prophet's explanation of the Qur'an by quoting Allah's (Exalted be He) Saying: "**We have neglected nothing in the Book**" [Al-An'am: 38] And: "**...and your Lord is never forgetful**" [Maryam: 64]
    4. He claims that adhering to the Sunnah, writing down and collecting the Hadiths that took place in the second and third centuries A.H. Was behind the downfall of the Islamic State.
    5. He questions the truthfulness of the incident of Al- Mi'raj (Ascension to Heaven) and that the Messenger (peace be upon him) was not the first to teach Muslims the manner by which they offer their Salah (Prayer), as the Arabs knew this way of performing Salah since their ancestor Ibrahim [Abraham] (peace be upon him).

He has certain interpretations regarding the writing of Al-Huruf Al-Muqatta'ah (unattached letters) mentioned at the beginning of Surahs (chapters) as he claims that the way they are written is not true. According to his opinion, these letters such as, "**Alif Lam Mim**" which are combined as one word in the 'Uthmany calligraphy, should be separately written, i.e. "Alif-Lam-Mim". Likewise, Allah's Saying, "**Nûn**" should be written with the three letters of which it is composed. To the end of other delusive and deviant opinions which disperse the unity of Muslims in addition to bearing clear opposition to Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him).

Therefore, **I considered it necessary to make things clear regarding the claims of this man, and expose his reality before the Muslims so that they would be aware of his fallacies**. Also, I want to fulfill the pledge, escape blame, and guide the Muslim Ummah. I hope you will send this letter to the concerned parties. 

May Allah help us to do goodness, follow the Sunnah and the Qur'an, be among those who call for Allah with knowledge, for He is the Most Generous!

As-salamu alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah's Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)
