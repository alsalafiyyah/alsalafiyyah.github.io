All praise be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, his Companions, and those who follow his guidance.
"Al-Musawwir" magazine has published an article in its issue no. 2166 on Friday April 15, 1966 A.D./1385 A.H., page 15 under the title: "**The imported principles by Ahmad Baha' Al-Din**", he wrote:

> "News from Saudi Arabia declares that the vice president of the Islamic University there published an article two months ago in all newspapers in which he deemed lawful to kill anyone who says that the earth is round or that the earth circulates around the sun and not the opposite. To announce such an opinion in 1966, seems bizarre, especially in the age of space. The holder of that opinion has only one merit counted for him; that this opinion seems to be reasonable in light of the thoughts and opinions spreading in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia nowadays. The rulers of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia have nothing to worry about but the imported ideologies and ideas. They only call for Islamic alliance under the pretext of guarding Muslims against the danger of the extrinsic ideas, while, for sure, they intend socialism. They do not bother themselves to study the concept of socialism or social equity; rather, they adamantly reject it on the grounds of being imported...and so on."

In reply to this, I say that this is a great lie. The article referred to by the author was published in all local newspaper in Ramadan 1385 A.H. and read by all inside and outside the Kingdom. There is no mention in it of the earth's roundness or that it is lawful to kill whoever holds this. The quotation I cited from the speech of the great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim (may Allah be merciful to him) includes proof that the earth is round. Thus, how on earth could Ahmad Baha' Al-Din or those who have transmitted this news to him propagate such falsehood and attribute it to an article that was published and read by people everywhere, may Allah be Glorified! I wonder how brazen-faced is that slanderer! However, there is no wonder that such a lie is being woven by advocates of atheism and destructive ideologies. 

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**It is only those who believe not in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, who fabricate falsehood, and it is they who are liars.**" [al-nahl: 105]

It is also authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "**Three are the signs of a hypocrite: when they speak, they tell lies; when they promise, they break their promise; and when they are entrusted, they betray.**" [^1]

I only deemed it lawful to kill whoever claims that the sun is static and refuses to repent of this after clarification. This is because denying the circulation of the sun constitutes a denial of Allah (Glorified be He), His Great Book, and His Honorable Messenger. It is well established in the Din (religion of Islam) by way of decisive evidence and Ijma` (consensus) of scholars that whoever denies Allah, His Messenger, or His Book is a Kafir (disbeliever) and their blood and wealth become violable. It is the duty of the responsible authority to ask them to repent of this; either they repent or be executed. Thanks to Allah that this issue is not debatable among scholars.

It is the duty of the responsible authority to ask them to repent of this; either they repent or be executed. Thanks to Allah that this issue is not debatable among scholars.

As regards the author's saying: "To announce such an opinion in 1966, seems bizarre, especially in the age of space...and so on." I say that, undoubtedly, spreading Al-Haqq (Truth) in this age and calling people to it has become bizarre at a time when Islam is suffering from desolation; callers to truth are a few while tempters of falsehood are so many. This goes in line with what our Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) told us in the Sahih (authentic) Hadith: "**Islam began as a stranger and will be back a stranger as it began so give glad tidings to the strangers.**" [^2]

In another narration: It was said, '**O Messenger of Allah! Who are the strangers?' He (peace be upon him) replied, 'Those who perform righteous deeds when others make mischief.**' [^3] In a third narration, he (peace be upon him) also said: "**Those who mend what others have ruined of my Sunnah.**" [^4]

Accordingly, this honorable Hadith makes it clear to men of understanding that calling to Al-Haqq and refuting falsehood woven by people when Islam is strange is the core of "reform" which the Prophet (peace be upon him) encouraged and praised those who undertake it. It is also apparent in this great Hadith that people of Haqq must exert great effort therein to clarify the rulings of Islam, call to it, spread virtue, and prohibit vice. They should set themselves aright to be of those who abide by righteousness when people are depraved and fix them when they are perverted. Allah (Glorified be He) is the One Who grants success.

As for the criticism the author made of those who oppose the imported ideologies and ideas and his accusation of the rulers of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia of fighting these imported ideologies and ideas such as socialism. He also claimed that they only call for Islamic alliances under the pretense of protecting Muslims from the danger of these imported ideas and so on. In response to this, I say: These imported ideologies and ideas include truth and falsehood at the same time. It is not permissible for Muslims to accept them blindly or totally reject them. Rather, this matter should be elaborated so that what benefits Muslims and complies with Allah's Shari`ah (Islamic law) should be accepted and utilized. Islam is the Perfect Din of Allah that calls to what is good and upright. On the other hand, it prohibits whatever harms Muslims and spoils their community. 

Also, this Din has ordained its followers to abide by that which benefits them, seek Allah's Help in that, prepare against their enemies all the power they can, beware of them, and cooperate in righteousness and Taqwa (fear or wariness of offending Allah). They must hold fast together to the Rope of Allah (i.e. this Qur'an) and not be divided among themselves. Along with this, Allah (Glorified be He) has warned them against following the evil desires of their enemies, clarifying that such enemies can avail them nothing against Him. It is an eminent truth that the wholesome concepts and ideologies have been originally brought forth by Islam, they are not imported from them; rather, it is Islam that has precedence over them in that, even if this is not known to its followers. The enemies simply get the ideologies that are consistent with the Shari`ah, spread them among people, and give them a false impression that they are their originators and callers. 

However, the fact is that Islam has the upper hand over them since it has guided them (i.e. the enemies of Islam) to the origins and fruits of that. Nevertheless, they attributed them to themselves and denied ascribing the right to the legitimate owners out of ignorance or grudges. When the Saudi government combats socialism or other destructive ideologies, it does not do so because they are imported but because they are atheist systems that disagree with the Shari'ah, reject the divine codes, oppose Allah (Glorified be He), and deny His Existence. Aside from this, they prohibit what He has enjoined as lawful and permit what He has prescribed as forbidden. 

Even if some of those ideologists cover themselves for certain reasons, the matter is still clear in their books which reveal their call, through their leader (Marx), the atheist Jew who declared it openly and invited to it, but it is as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts which are in the breasts that grow blind." [al-Hajj: 46]

The Saudi government has imported many other useful things and does not oppose them when it finds them useful. 

Regarding the writer's claim that the rulers of Saudi Arabia only called for Islamic alliance under the pretense of fending off the danger of the imported ideas, it can be refuted by clarifying that they have not called for an Islamic alliance, rather, Islamic solidarity, cooperation, and support to which Allah and His Messenger ordained us to pledge our allegiance. Again, Allah has commanded Muslims to abide by Allah's Rope and be not scattered and to help one another in virtuousness and Taqwa and stand together as a solid structure against their enemies. They should also fight any idea or conviction that contradicts their Din. 

This, however, cannot be deemed as an alliance, it is something more supreme, for it is a sanctified duty and a foreordained obligation imposed on all Muslim kings, leaders, and scholars. They must abide by Allah's Din, protect it and call to it, and be joined together in confronting their enemies and thwarting their plots and conspiracies in accordance with Allah's Saying (Glorified and Exalted be He): "**You [true believers in Islâmic Monotheism, and real followers of Prophet Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) and his Sunnah] are the best of peoples ever raised up for mankind; you enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm has ordained) and forbid Al-Munkar (polytheism, disbelief and all that Islâm has forbidden), and you believe in Allâh.**" [Aal Imran: 110]

Allah (Glorified be He) also says: "**Truly! This, your Ummah [Shari‘ah or religion (Islâmic Monotheism)] is one religion, and I am your Lord, therefore worship Me (Alone). [Tafsîr Ibn Kathîr]**" [Al-Anbiya: 92] And: "**And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allâh (i.e. this Qur’ân), and be not divided among yourselves**" [Aal Imran: 103]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: "**Indeed, Allah is pleased with three things from you. That you worship Him (Alone) and not associate anything with Him; that you hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allah and be not divided among yourselves; and that you give sincere advise to those whom Allah put in charge of your affairs.**" Related by Imam Malik in "Al-Muwwatta'" and Imam Ahmad in his Musnad through a Sahih (authentic) Isnad (chain of narrators). [^5]

It was also related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih book of Hadith without the part in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**...and that you give sincere advise to those whom Allah put in charge of your affairs.**" (See footnore no [^5])

He (peace be upon him) also said: "**'A believer to a believer is like a building whose different parts support one another.' And he (peace be upon him) intertwined his fingers.**" (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^6]

There is also his saying (peace be upon him): "**The similitude of believers in regard to their mutual love, mercy, and compassion is that of the body; when any of its parts complains, the whole body calls upon one another (sharing) with (it) sleeplessness and fever.**" (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^7]

There are many Ayahs and Hadiths mentioned to that effect.

When his majesty, King Faysal, the sovereign of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - may Allah grant him success - called for the Islamic solidarity and the unification of Muslims together in the face of the pending dangers, he has fulfilled a great duty and a respectable praiseworthy pursuit. All Muslim leaders, scholars, and persons of distinction should support him in that and join their efforts with him to make the Word of Allah prevalent, grant victory to His Din, rule according to His Shari'ah, besides purifying the `Aqidah (creed) of people from destructive ideologies, deviant ideas, and false conventions. All of them must set up their efforts and make their forces ready to this imminent danger. They ought to be fully equipped, have a significant political, economic and industrial weight among the international community, as well as mastering the elements that empower them and enable them to withstand danger in keeping with the instructions of their Din and the guidance of the Qur'an. 

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**O you who believe! Take your precautions**" [al-Nisa: 71 

He (Glorified be He) also says: "**And make ready against them all you can of power**" [al-Anfal: 60]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Verily, strength is in archery. Verily, strength is in archery.**" [^8]

He (peace be upon him) also said: "**A strong believer is better and more beloved to Allah than a weak believer, yet, both are good. Persist in doing that which benefits you, seek the Support of Allah and do not feel helpless.**" (Related by Muslim in his Sahih) [^9]

I ask Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to grant all Muslim kings, presidents, leaders, scholars, and others success in leading this Ummah (nation based on one creed) to righteousness, safety, and happiness in this worldly life and in the Hereafter. I also implore Him to unite their word, give them a good understanding of His Din, and fortify everyone against the evils of their souls, their misdeeds and the plots of their enemies. Indeed, Allah is All-Able to do anything. May peace be upon Allah's Servant and Messenger, our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
