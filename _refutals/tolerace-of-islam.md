All praise be to Allah Alone. May peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet.In its issue no (3031), dated (27/1394), Okaz newspaper published an article regarding the observance of Jumu`ah (Friday) Prayer in the Mosque of Cordova. It mentioned that observing this event places emphasis on the relationship of brotherhood and affection between Muslims and Christians. In the same context, the Muslim World Journal dated 29/1394 A.H., published the same article in the following wording: "Undoubtedly, this act is an emphasis on the tolerance of Islam and that we all have one religion, etc."

These words contradict the legal evidence stating that there is neither brotherhood, nor affection between Muslims and non-Muslims. Brotherhood is only among Muslims themselves. There is no unity between Islam and Christianity. Islam is the true faith that should be accepted by all people. As for Christianity, it is a distorted and deviant religion as affirmed in the Text of the Noble Qur'an. Among the proofs in support of this fact is Allah's, the Glorified, statement in Surah Al-Hujurat: "The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islâmic religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers" and in Surah Al-Mumtahanah: "Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: "Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone"

Allah also states in Surah Al-Mujadalah: "You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rûh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow to dwell therein (forever). Allâh is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allâh. Verily, it is the Party of Allâh that will be the successful."
