All praise be to Allah Alone. May peace and blessings be upon the Last Prophet.In its issue no (3031), dated (27/1394), **Okaz newspaper** published an article regarding the observance of Jumu'ah (Friday) Prayer in the Mosque of Cordova. It mentioned that observing this event places emphasis on the relationship of brotherhood and affection between Muslims and Christians. In the same context, the Muslim World Journal dated 29/1394 A.H., published the same article in the following wording: 

> "**Undoubtedly, this act is an emphasis on the tolerance of Islam and that we all have one religion, etc.**"

These words contradict the legal evidence stating that there is neither brotherhood, nor affection between Muslims and non-Muslims. Brotherhood is only among Muslims themselves. There is no unity between Islam and Christianity. Islam is the true faith that should be accepted by all people. As for Christianity, it is a distorted and deviant religion as affirmed in the Text of the Noble Qur'an. Among the proofs in support of this fact is Allah's, the Glorified, statement in Surah Al-Hujurat: "**The believers are nothing else than brothers (in Islâmic religion). So make reconciliation between your brothers**" [al-Hujurat: 10] and in Surah Al-Mumtahanah: "**Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: "Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone**" [al-Mumtahanah: 4]

Allah also states in Surah Al-Mujadalah: "**You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rûh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow to dwell therein (forever). Allâh is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allâh. Verily, it is the Party of Allâh that will be the successful.**" [al-Mujadillah: 22]

In Surah At-Tawbah: "**The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another**" [al-Tawbah: 71]

In Surah Al-Ma'idah, Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them (as Auliyâ’), then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust).**" [al-Maidah: 51]

Allah also says in Surah Al-'Imrân, "**Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm. In the same Surah, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.**" [Aal Imran: 85] 

Likewise, in Surah Al-Ma'idah Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**Surely, they have disbelieved who say: "Allâh is the Messiah [‘Isâ (Jesus)], son of Maryam (Mary).**" [al-Maidah: 72]

In the same Surah, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**Surely, disbelievers are those who said: “Allâh is the third of the three (in a Trinity).” But there is no Ilâh (god) (none who has the right to be worshipped) but One Ilâh (God - Allâh).**" [al-maidah: 73]

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in Surah Al-Kahf: "**Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): "Shall We tell you the greatest losers in respect of (their) deeds? "Those whose efforts have been wasted in this life while they thought that they were acquiring good by their deeds. "They are those who deny the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord and the Meeting with Him (in the Hereafter). So their works are in vain, and on the Day of Resurrection, We shall assign no weight for them.**" [al-Kahf: 103-105]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, "**A Muslim is a brother of another Muslim, so he should not oppress him, nor should he hand him over to an oppressor...**" [^1]

This Hadith is narrated by Muslim. These sacred Ayahs (Qur'anic verses), this Noble Hadith, and all other relevant Ayahs and Hadiths provide a manifest indication that brotherhood and affection can never be established except among Muslims themselves.

As for non-Muslims, they should be resented and opposed for their disbelief in Allah, the Glorified. It is prohibited to support or take care of them until they believe in Allah Alone and abandon their disbelief and deviation.

The last Ayahs indicate that the true faith is Islam which Allah sent down upon His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and all His Messengers. This is exactly what is meant when the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated, "**The prophets are paternal brothers, their mothers are different and their religion is one.**" Narrated by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih (authentic Book of Hadith). [^2]

All beliefs other than Islam including Judaism, Christianity, and others are false and defective. The Shari'ah (Islamic law) which was propagated by our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) has brought about Al-Haqq (the Truth) and even more, for it is a comprehensive perfect Shari'ah for all people of the earth. 

Other Shari'ahs were abrogated by that of Muhammad (peace be upon him) which is the most perfect, general, and most useful Shari'ah for Servants of Allah in this life and the Hereafter. Allah, the Glorified, addressed His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) stating, "**And We have sent down to you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) the Book (this Qur’ân) in truth, confirming the Scripture that came before it and Muhaymin (trustworthy in highness and a witness) over it (old Scriptures). So judge among them by what Allâh has revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging away from the truth that has come to you. To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.**" [al-Maidah: 48] 

Allah has enjoined on all people of sound mind to follow Him and hold fast to His Law. After mentioning the attributes of Muhammad (peace be upon him) in Surah Al-A'raf, Allah, the Exalted, states, "**So those who believe in him (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), honour him, help him, and follow the light (the Qur’ân) which has been sent down with him, it is they who will be successful.**" [al-A'raf: 157]

Then, Allah the Glorified and Exalted, states, "**Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): "O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh - to Whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). It is He Who gives life and causes death. So believe in Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), the Prophet who can neither read nor write (i.e. Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), who believes in Allâh and His Words [(this Qur’ân), the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel) and also Allâh’s Word: "Be!" - and he was, i.e. ‘Isâ (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary), عليهما السلام], and follow him so that you may be guided."**" [al-A'raf: 158]

So here in this Ayah, Allah has deemed those who did not make the Prophet their judge in all disputes as having no faith. Allah, the Glorified, in Surah An-Nisa' states, "**But no, by your Lord, they can have no Faith, until they make you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) judge in all disputes between them, and find in themselves no resistance against your decisions, and accept (them) with full submission.**" [al-Nisa: 65]

He judged the Jews and the Christians as Kafirs (disbelievers) and Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) for they ascribed the attribute of giving birth to Allah, the Glorified and for they made their rabbis and their monks their lords besides Allah, the Glorified and Exalted. 

Allah, the Exalted, in Surah At-Tawbah states, "**And the Jews say: ‘Uzair (Ezra) is the son of Allâh, and the Christians say: Messiah is the son of Allâh. That is their saying with their mouths, resembling the saying of those who disbelieved aforetime. Allâh’s Curse be on them, how they are deluded away from the truth! They (Jews and Christians) took their rabbis and their monks to be their lords besides Allâh (by obeying them in things which they made lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered by Allâh), and (they also took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded [in the Taurât (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)] to worship none but One Ilâh (God - Allâh) Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and glory be to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him)." They (the disbelievers, the Jews and the Christians) want to extinguish Allâh’s Light (with which Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم has been sent - Islâmic Monotheism) with their mouths, but Allâh will not allow except that His Light should be perfected even though the Kâfirûn (disbelievers) hate (it). It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it).**" [al-Tawbah: 30-33]

If it is said that such ceremonies are an expression of the cooperative relationship between people of the two faiths, this is good and permissible. I felt obligated to bring this matter to your attention in order to fulfill my duty of extending advice to people for the sake of Allah. Indeed, this serious matter may confuse some people.

May Allah grant all Muslims and us success in establishing true brotherhood for the Sake of Allah and grant us affection in His Cause. May Allah guide humanity to accept the Deen of Allah sent down on His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), adhere to it, judge by it, and abstain from all its prohibitions! Verily, this is the everlasting happiness and survival in this world and in the Hereafter. It provides a solution to every present problem and in the future, for it is extremely benevolent. May peace and blessings be upon His Servant and Messenger, Prophet Muhammad, upon his family and Companions!
