Question:

We were informed that a translation of the Qur'an by Muhammad Asad would be published soon in  Dublin, Ireland. This translation will be distributed here. A committee, from among Indian Muslim Professors, has been formed to publish this translation.  Muhammad Asad alleges in his translation that Prophet 'Isa (Jesus) died and that the Muslims' belief in his return is not true. In the light of this allegation, I would like to ask the following questions: 

> 1: What is the status of prophet 'Isa according to the Qur'an and the authentic Sunnah? 

Answer 1:

Allah (Exalted be He) created His Prophet 'Isa from a mother only. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And mention in the Book (the Qur’ân, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Ruh [angel Jibrîl (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects. She said: "Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allâh) from you, if you do fear Allâh." (The angel) said: "I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son." She said: "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?" He said: "So (it will be), your Lord said: ‘That is easy for Me (Allâh): And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allâh), and it is a matter (already) decreed, (by Allâh).’ " So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place (i.e. Bethlehem valley about 4-6 miles from Jerusalem). And the pains of childbirth drove her to the trunk of a date-palm. She said: "Would that I had died before this, and had been forgotten and out of sight!" Then [the babe ‘Isâ (Jesus) or Jibrîl (Gabriel)] cried unto her from below her, saying: "Grieve not: your Lord has provided a water stream under you. "And shake the trunk of date-palm towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe-dates upon you." "So eat and drink and be glad. And if you see any human being, say: ‘Verily! I have vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious (Allâh) so I shall not speak to any human being this day.’" Then she brought him (the baby) to her people, carrying him.**" [Maryam: 16-27]

This indicates that 'Isa was born from his mother Maryam only, without a father by the Will and Word of Allah. He had no father, and therefore he is a sign for mankind. However, the Jews accused Maryam of committing adultery. Therefore, Allah made her son 'Isa pronounce her innocence while he was still in the cradle. 

Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**They said: “O Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing Fariyy (a mighty thing). "O sister (i.e. the like) of Hârûn (Aaron)! Your father was not a man who used to commit adultery, nor your mother was an unchaste woman." Then she pointed to him. They said: "How can we talk to one who is a child in the cradle?" "He [‘Isâ (Jesus)] said: "Verily I am a slave of Allâh, He has given me the Scripture and made me a Prophet;" "And He has made me blessed wheresoever I be, and has enjoined on me Salât (prayer), and Zakât, as long as I live." "And dutiful to my mother, and made me not arrogant, unblest. "And Salâm (peace) be upon me the day I was born, and the day I die, and the day I shall be raised alive!" Such is ‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary). (It is) a statement of truth, about which they doubt (or dispute). It befits not (the Majesty of) Allâh that He should beget a son [this refers to the slander of Christians against Allâh, by saying that ‘Isâ (Jesus) is the son of Allâh]. Glorified (and Exalted) be He (above all that they associate with Him). When He decrees a thing, He only says to it: "Be!" - and it is.**" [Maryam: 27-35]

Therefore, Allah exonerates him with this miracle, from being an illegitimate child and holding Himself high above having a son. Thus, 'Isa is not the son of Allah. Maryam said that no human being had sexual intercourse with her. Allah confirmed her saying and ascribed her son to her more than once in the Qur'an. Had 'Isa had a father, Allah would have ascribed him to his father as this is the law of Allah in His words. This confirms that 'Isa was born from a mother only and that he is the prophet and messenger of Allah as is established in the previous and other Ayahs.

> 2: What is the ruling on a person who claims that 'Isa (Jesus) is dead?

Answer 2:

It has been confirmed by evidence from the Qur'an and the Sahih (authentic) Sunnah that 'Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon them) was not killed nor is he dead. In fact, Allah raised him up to the heavens alive and he will descend at the end of time, as a just judge for this Ummah (nation). Therefore, anyone who claims that 'Isa ibn Maryam is dead and will not descend at the end of time, has contradicted the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), and committed a grave mistake. The ruling is that they have committed Kufr (disbelief) if, after the matter has been explained to them and they have been given the evidence, they continue to belie Allah and His Messenger. 

> 3: Is there any evidence in support of the idea that 'Isa (Jesus) promulgated Christianity to the people of India, Afghanistan, Sind, and Iran? 

Answer 3:

The basic rule in this regard lies in the Qur'an and the authentically reported Sunnah of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), not reason. To know about this issue, there should be a revelation about it. We cannot trust history books, because they are not transmitted through connected chains of narrations by reliable narrators. Therefore, history books include many falsifications. There does not exist any support in the Qur'an for the claim that 'Isa (Jesus (peace be upon him)) promulgated his religion in the above-mentioned countries. As far as we know, it is not authentically reported that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said any Hadith supporting this claim. However, it is authentically reported that Allah sent 'Isa (Jesus) to the children of Israel and that he conveyed His Lord's Message. It is commonly believed that Christianity was threatened by the Jews after Allah raised Christ (Son of Mary) to Him. But for the Roman Rule, Christianity would not have spread. This is a historical issue that does not entail any religious consequences. 

> 4: Why was the translation mentioned above published in a Muslim country taking into account that Muhammad Asad - to my knowledge - is living in the Kingdom of Morocco? I find nothing in the Qur’an or the Sunnah to support the issues mentioned in it. I hope that your Fatwa will back me to refute these matters and prevent the publication of this translation here.

Answer 4:

The translation referred to contains fatal errors and flagrant false beliefs. As a result, the Constitutional Council of the Muslim World League in Makkah Al-Mukarramah issued a decree banning the print and publication of this translation.
