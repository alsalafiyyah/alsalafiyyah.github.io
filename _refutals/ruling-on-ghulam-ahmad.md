All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.

I have reviewed the article published in Al-Hajj Magazine, in its second issue dated 16 Sha'ban, 1382 A.H., on the Fatwa request submitted to it by our fellow scholar, Shaykh Muhammad Yusuf Al-Banury, principal of the Arab Islamic School in Karachi, about the ruling of Shari'ah (Islamic law) regarding Ghulam Ahmad Pervez who has recently come into view in the lands of India, and regarding his beliefs, examples of which were presented by the reverend questioner. He also enquired about the religious ruling on those who follow, embrace, and call to such beliefs, and so on.

The examples of the beliefs of Ghulam Ahmad Pervez as quoted by the questioner in his Fatwa request published in the said magazine, amount to twenty. All people endowed with knowledge and insight, who examine such examples, will realize beyond doubt that he who embraces and calls to such beliefs has fallen into major Kufr (disbelief) and apostatized from Islam. Therefore, he should be invited to repent. He must unequivocally repent of his former beliefs and belie them, and publish such repentance in local newspapers - just as he had published his false beliefs therein. Otherwise, it becomes obligatory for the ruler of the Muslims to execute him; a ruling which is Ma'lum minad-din biddarurah (well-established and known Islamic principles). The proofs corroborating such a ruling in the Qur'an, the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and the Ijma' (consensus of scholars) are too many to be surveyed in the present answer. All the examples presented by the questioner of the beliefs of Ghulam Ahmad Pervez necessitate declaring him a Kafir (disbeliever) and Murtad (apostate), according to the scholars of Shari'ah.

Here we quote some of the referred to examples so that the readers would realize how much heinous, offensive, and far from Islam are such beliefs, and would recognize that those who embrace them do not believe in Allah, the Day of Resurrection, the Messenger (peace be upon him), or what Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and His Messenger informed of regarding the Hereafter, Paradise, and the Fire. Besides, the reader would perceive that those who embrace such beliefs are far distanced from what the messengers were sent with, and that they harbor bitter enmity, grudge, and intrigue against Islam and Muslims. Moreover, they are crafty plotters, skilled in confusing people, and are bereft of decency and good manners.

We ask Allah (Exalted be He) for well-being and safety - for us and for all Muslims - from the evil inflicted on that evil atheist.

1. The first example of the beliefs of the atheist Ghulam Ahmad Pervez according to what is mentioned in the Fatwa request published in the referred to magazine, reads: "All that is stated in the Glorious Qur'an of Sadaqah (voluntary charity), inheritance, and other financial rulings are temporary, and are intended to gradually rise up to an independent role, namely [he calls it] the system of Rububiyyah (Lordship). Thus, when the time comes, these rulings will come to an end, since they are temporary and subordinate."
2. The second example: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) and his Companions deduced from the Qur'an rulings that turned out to be Shari'ah. Likewise, all those who follow him are consultative members of a central government entitled to infer from the Qur'an rulings that, in turn, become the Shari'ah of their age, while they are not required to apply the preceding Shari'ah. Moreover, such a process is not limited to only one aspect of the Shari'ah, but it rather applies to the acts of worship, transactions, and morals. That is why the Qur'an did not specify the details of worship."
3. The third example: "Allah (Exalted be He) says: Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority." [Al-nisa: 59] The meaning of obedience to Allah and His Messenger is obedience to the center of the Ummah (nation based on one creed), that is, the central government, while 'those who are in authority' refers to the assemblies held under its rule. Thus, the government alone assumes legislation. Besides, obedience to Allah does not mean obedience to His Book, the Qur'an, neither does obedience to the Messenger mean conformity with his Hadiths. For every central government instituted after the age of revelation enjoy the position of the Messenger, and, thus, obedience to Allah and His Messenger surely mean obedience to such a government. Even more, the Messenger was obeyed because of being the commander and leader of the central government, while what was obeyed was the central government itself."
4. The fourth example: "The Glorious Qur'an states that the Prophet (peace be upon him) does not deserve to be obeyed, and that he does not have the right to impose obedience to him on Muslims. Besides, obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) means nothing but obedience to the center of the religious system, which implements the rulings of the Qur'an only."
5. The sixth example: "Paradise and Fire do not refer to certain places, but they rather refer to the conditions of man."
6. The nineteenth example: "Belief in Predestination, both the good and the evil thereof, is a Magian subterfuge made as a creed for Muslims."

These, dear readers, are samples contained in the Fatwa request published in the magazine (presented in the same way they are arranged in the Fatwa request), so that you may conceive the correctness of what I mentioned above. When the readers review the other examples published in the magazine, they would find evidence of the heinous ideas and Kufr of Ghulam Ahmad. 

This leads us to many of Allah's clear signs and conclusive proofs confirming His Wisdom in His Creation and His Absolute Ability to turn hearts and to seal their doom through deviation so that they could reach almost inconceivable limits. Praise be to Allah! How Sublime is He and how Perfect is His Power! Allah says: "**Thus does Allâh seal up the hearts of those who know not [the proofs and evidence of the Oneness of Allâh i.e. those who try not to understand true facts that which you (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) have brought to them].**" [Al-Rum: 59]

These quoted examples, and also those unquoted, are proven Batil (false) through many Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and authentic Hadiths and through the Ijma'. 

The Ayahs include the Words of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He): "**Say (O Muslims), "We believe in Allâh and that which has been sent down to us and that which has been sent down to Ibrâhîm (Abraham), Ismâ‘îl (Ishmael), Ishâq (Isaac), Ya‘qûb (Jacob), and to Al-Asbât [the offspring of the twelve sons of Ya‘qûb (Jacob)], and that which has been given to Mûsâ (Moses) and ‘Isâ (Jesus), and that which has been given to the Prophets from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and to Him we have submitted (in Islâm)." So if they believe in the like of that which you believe, then they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, then they are only in opposition. So Allâh will suffice you against them. And He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower."**" [Al-Baqarah: 136-137]

This atheist has never believed in what Allah sent down to Muhammad (peace be upon him) and to the preceding messengers. Rather, he wholeheartedly denied it, as indicated through his denial of obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and of His Shari'ah, and his disbelief in Paradise and Fire, and his rejection of Predestination. Indeed, this asserts that he is not only aberrant but also among the people of dissension, disbelief, and atheism. 

Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm.**" [Aal Imran: 19] Yet, this atheist denies this religion and believes that obedience to the Messenger (peace be upon him) was confined to his lifetime, and that he was obeyed, not because of being the Messenger of Allah, but because he was the leader of the central government. Likewise, he denies obedience to Allah and refuses to conform to it, since - for him - obedience is due only to the central government, no matter what form it takes. Such is an explicit denial of Allah and the Qur'an and plain negation of Islam and of the fact that it is the religion that must be embraced. Moreover, he believes that the authoritative religion is that which is enacted by the central government, even if it contradicts the Qur'an and the Sunnah.  In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.**" [Aal Imran: 85]

In addition, this atheist - as shown above - does not accept this Ayah, and in turn he belies Allah and opposes Him. Hence, he will be one of the losers in the Hereafter, knowing that the loser in the Hereafter or the absolute loser is the Kafir, who deserves everlasting torture in the Fire. We seek refuge with Allah against such an end. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.**" [Al-Nisa: 59]

He (Exalted be He) also says: "**The command (or the judgement) is for none but Allâh. He has commanded that you worship none but Him (i.e. His Monotheism); that is the (true) straight religion**" [Yusuf: 40]

"**And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allâh (He is the ruling Judge).**" [Al-shura: 10]

This deviating atheist, however, rejects all these Ayahs and denies both obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and referral to them for judgment (as already indicated above). Furthermore, he believes that all such matters are due for the central government. This is enough to declare him a Kafir and proves the corruption of his beliefs and his opposition to Allah, His Book, His Messenger, and the Muslims. There is no need to present an argument in confirmation of the Kufr, aberrancy, and deviation of the one holding such beliefs, for it is as clear as daylight. Besides, there are numerous Ayahs to this effect.

As for the Hadith, it is authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith and others that he said: "**Every prophet would be sent to his nation only, but I have been sent to all mankind.**" [^1]

It is also authentically reported he (peace be upon him) said: "**My entire Ummah will enter Paradise except the one who refuses. It was said, 'O Messenger of Allah, who will refuse?' He (peace be upon him) said, 'Whoever obeys me will enter Paradise, and whoever disobeys me is the one who refuses.'**" (Related by Al-Bukhari) [^2]

Again, Allah (Glorified be He) says in the Glorious Qur'an: "**Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): "O mankind! Verily, I am sent to you all as the Messenger of Allâh.**" [Al-A'raf: 158]

"**He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad (peace be upon him)), has indeed obeyed Allâh**" [Al-Nisa: 80]

However, this atheist does not believe that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent by Allah, that he must be obeyed, or that he is a Messenger to all mankind. Rather, he believes that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was only to be obeyed during his lifetime and only on the grounds of his being the head of the central government, not because of his being the Messenger of Allah. So, praise be to Allah, how heinous is such a claim and how far distanced from guidance is it! 

According to well-established religious matters that are recorded in authentic references, the Muslims unanimously agree that whoever belies Allah or His Messenger (peace be upon him), even if about a small matter, or deems apostasy from Islam permissible, or says that the Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent to the Arabs only or to the people living during his lifetime, becomes a Kafir and Murtad, whose execution is declared lawful and whose money is to be seized. Praise be to Allah, this point is uncontroversial among religious scholars, and, thus, there is no need for more elaboration on this matter by quoting their unanimity from reliable sources. 

I hope that what is already mentioned is satisfactory for the questioner and for the readers in general. Undoubtedly, the Kufr of Ghulam Ahmad Pervez according to what is quoted of his beliefs and opinions, is taken for granted by common Muslims, not to mention scholars. Thus, there is no more need to state in great detail the proofs of such a claim. We ask Allah to safeguard the Muslims from the evil of Ghulam Ahmad and those like him, to bridle the enemies of Islam wherever they may be, to foil their intrigues, and to let them perish in their rage without fulfilling their intentions. Indeed, He is Able to do all things.

Allah (Alone) is Sufficient for us, and He is the Best Disposer of affairs (for us). There is neither might nor power except with Him. May peace and blessings be upon His Servant and Messenger, our Master and Imam, Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah, who was sent to all mankind with the perfect Shari'ah until the Day of Resurrection, and upon his family and Companions, and upon those who uprightly follow them until the Day of Resurrection. All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.
