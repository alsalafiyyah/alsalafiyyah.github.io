Question: 

It is well-known that some people think they were evolved from animals following Darwinism, what is the view of Your Eminence regarding this?

Answer: 

The theory of Darwin states that man evolved from an ape-like creature and that human beings are talking animals and that we are all animals. Allah created a life for the sons of Adam and granted them minds and the ability to speak. This abominable theory is false according to Ijma' (consensus of scholars). Apes are a species, dogs are a species and so are the pigs, cats, lions, tigers, cheetahs, etc. As for human beings, they are distinct speaking and rational species whom Allah created from semen of despised water. Allah created our father Adam (peace be upon him) from clay, so he is a distinct species and so are all sons of Adam. The Jinn (creatures created from fire) - as well - are created from a smokeless flame of fire. Every kind of animals is a distinct species, even the ants.
