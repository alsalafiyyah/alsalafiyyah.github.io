 What is the difference between 'Aqidah and Manhaj?
 </h3>
 <div class="panel" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
  <div itemprop="text" class="answer">
   There is no difference between ‘Aqidah and Manhaj. Both terms refer to what a person believes in their hearts, confesses with their tongues, and acts accordingly with their bodily members. They encompass believing in the Oneness of Allah’s Lordship, Worship, His Names and Attributes, worshipping Him Alone, abiding by His Shari’ah (Islamic law) in words and deeds, and following the Qur’an and the Sunnah as adopted by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and Imams (initiators of Schools of Jurisprudence). Accordingly, there is no difference between 'Aqidah and Manhaj; they refer to the same thing which all Muslims must observe and hold fast to.

  What are the fundamentals and principles of the Salafi Da'wah?
 </h3>
 <div class="panel" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
  <div itemprop="text" class="answer">
   The Salafi Da’wah is a call to follow the footsteps of the Messenger (peace be upon him), his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them), and those who follow them in righteousness, with wisdom, fair preaching, and arguing in the best way along with struggling with one’s soul to act accordingly toward all that the person is calling for.

  Are the Hanbalis are the only Salafis?
 </h3>
 <div class="panel" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
  <div itemprop="text" class="answer">
   This is not true. The Salaf (righteous predecessors) were the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) and those who followed their way from among the Tabi’un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and their successors among Al-Hanafiyyah (the followers of Imam Abu Hanifah’s School of Jurisprudence), Al-Malikiyyah, Al-Shafi’iyyah Al-Hanabilah and others who followed Al-Haqq (the Truth) and adhered to the glorious Qur’an and the purified Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) in regard to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism), the Names and Attributes of Allah, and all matters of the Din (religion of Islam). <br/> We ask Allah to make us among them and to help all Muslims everywhere - governments and people - to adhere to His Glorious Qur’an and the Sunnah of His Honest Messenger, to rule by them, to seek judgments from them, and to avoid anything that contradicts them. He is the Guardian of this and the One Who is Capable of doing so. May Allah grant us success.

  Wahhabism, what is it?
 </h3>
 <div class="panel" itemscope itemprop="acceptedAnswer" itemtype="https://schema.org/Answer">
  <div itemprop="text" class="answer">
   Wahhabism is a word used by the enemies of Salafiyyah. They use it to describe those who followed Imam Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab ibn Sulayman ibn Ali Al-Tamimi Al-Hanbali, who died in 1206 AH in Al-Dir’iyyah. He proclaimed Da’wah to Allah in the second half of the twelfth century AH in Najd, Al-Dir’iyyah, and in the area around there. He made Da’wah to the Tawhid of Allah and resisted what the people used to do at graves or with the dead and idols, not to mention their belief in soothsayers and fortune-tellers as well as worshiping trees and stones. He did this while adopting the approach of the Salaf, in the same way which Allah sent His Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), in the way that the Companions of Allah’s Prophet (peace be upon him) did. He, and other scholars from among his relatives, children and others, called to Allah. <br/>
