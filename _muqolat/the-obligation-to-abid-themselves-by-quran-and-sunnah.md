excerpt: "Allah (Exalted be He) has pointed out that the straight path is belief in the guidance and the religion of truth with which He sent His Prophet (peace be upon him) and to act according to them. Whoever follows this straight path and is steadfast in it, will attain Paradise and honor. Whoever deviates from it and follows his whims, will incur loss and evil destiny. Allah (Exalted be He) commands all His slaves to follow the straight path and prohibits them to follow other paths, which lead them to the path of Hellfire."

All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds. The best outcome is for the righteous. May peace and blessings be upon the slave and Messenger of Allah, whom He entrusted with His Revelation and chose from among His creation, our Prophet, Imam and master Muhammad, son of 'Abdullah, and upon his family, his Companions and those follow his way and adopt his guidance until the Day of Judgment. To proceed:

Indeed, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) sent His Prophet (peace be upon him) with guidance and the religion of truth. Allah (Exalted be He) says in Surah Al-Tawbah and Surah Al-Saff: "It is He Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), to make it superior over all religions even though the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) hate (it)." [Al-Tawbah: 33]

Allah (Exalted be He) also says in Surah Al-Fath: "He it is Who has sent His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) with guidance and the religion of truth (Islâm), that He may make it (Islâm) superior to all religions. And All-Sufficient is Allâh as a Witness." [Al-Fath: 28]

Scholars of Tafsir (exegesis of the meanings of the Qur'an), may Allah bestow His mercy upon them, said: Guidance is that with which Allah (Exalted be He) sent His Prophet (peace be upon him) comprising useful knowledge and truthful information. Whereas, the religion of truth is that with which Allah sent him (peace be upon him) comprising righteous deeds and just rulings.

Allah (Exalted be He) has pointed out that the straight path is belief in the guidance and the religion of truth with which He sent His Prophet (peace be upon him) and to act according to them. Whoever follows this straight path and is steadfast in it, will attain Paradise and honor. Whoever deviates from it and follows his whims, will incur loss and evil destiny. Allah (Exalted be He) commands all His slaves to follow the straight path and prohibits them to follow other paths, which lead them to the path of Hellfire. Therefore, He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says in Surah Al-An'am: "And verily, this (i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - see V.2:2)." [Al-An'am: 153] His saying: "And verily, this" refers to the injunctions that He previously commanded His Prophet (peace be upon him) to recite to people and explain to them in order to understand and heed them. This is clear in His Words (Exalted be He): " Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): "Come, I will recite what your Lord has prohibited you from: Join not anything in worship with Him; be good and dutiful to your parents; kill not your children because of poverty - We provide sustenance for you and for them; come not near to Al-Fawâhish (shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse) whether committed openly or secretly; and kill not anyone whom Allâh has forbidden, except for a just cause (according to Islâmic law). This He has commanded you that you may understand." "And come not near to the orphan’s property, except to improve it, until he (or she) attains the age of full strength; and give full measure and full weight with justice. We burden not any person, but that which he can bear. And whenever you give your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned, and fulfil the Covenant of Allâh. This He commands you, that you may remember." [Al-An'am: 151-152]

Then, He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "And verily, this (i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so follow it" [Al-An'am: 153] In these Ayahs (Qur'anic verses), Allah (Exalted be He) has explained that following these orders and staying away from His Prohibitions is the straight path, which He commands to be followed. It is noted that Allah (Exalted be He) started these Ayahs by warning against Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and explaining that it is prohibited for the Muslim Ummah (nation based on one creed) because it is the most heinous sin and the gravest crime. That is also because it opposes Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism), which is the greatest obligation, the most important duty, the foundation of religion and the basis of the straight path. It is that with which Allah (Exalted be He) sent all the Messengers, and because of which He revealed all the Books. It is that for which Jinn and mankind were created. He (Exalted be He) says: "And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should worship Me (Alone)." Al-Dhariyat: 56]

Allah (Exalted be He) also says: "And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a Messenger (proclaiming): “Worship Allâh (Alone), and avoid (or keep away from) Tâghût (all false deities i.e. do not worship Tâghût besides Allâh).”" [Al-Nahl: 36]

In another Ayah, Allah (Exalted be He) says: And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) but We revealed to him (saying): Lâ ilâha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allâh)], so worship Me (Alone and none else)." [Al-Anbiya: 25] Allah reiterates this commandment several times in His Book and in the words of His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him). Allah (Exalted be He) says: "O mankind! Worship your Lord (Allâh), Who created you and those who were before you so that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - See V.2:2)." [Al-Baqarah: 21]

He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: "And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him." [Al-Isra: 23]

In another Ayah, He (Exalted be He) says: "And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)" [Al-Bayyinah: 5] Allah (Exalted be He) guides His slaves in Surah Al-Fatihah to acknowledge this truth, saying:  "All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). The Most Gracious, the Most Merciful. The Only Owner (and the Only Ruling Judge) of the Day of Recompense (i.e. the Day of Resurrection) You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything)." [Al-Fatihah: 1-5] There are many Ayahs in this regard.

It is reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from Ibn 'Abbas (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) "**That the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to Mu'adh, 'Do you know what is the right of Allah upon His slaves? And what is the right of the slaves upon Allah (Exalted be He)?' Mu'adh said, 'Allah and His Messenger know best.' He (peace be upon him) said, 'The Right of Allah upon His slaves is that they should worship Him and should not associate any partner with Him...'**" [^1]

He (peace be upon him) also said: "Whoever dies while still invoking a rival (in worship) to Allah, will enter the Fire (Hell)."(Related by Al-Bukhari in his Sahih)[^2]

There are many other Hadiths reported in this regard. This is the meaning of the testimony there is no god but Allah. It means that no one is truly worthy of worship except Allah (Exalted be He). Thus, it negates all types of worshipping other than Allah (Exalted be He) and confirms that all forms of worship in truth must be devoted to Allah Alone. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "That is because Allâh, He is the Truth, and that which they invoke besides Him is Al-Bâtil (falsehood, Satan and all other false deities)" [Luqman: 30]

Allah (Exalted be He) then mentions the right of parents, which is to treat them kindly and never to show impiety to them. He (Exalted be He) also prohibited killing children for fear of poverty. He (Exalted be He) informed us that He is the Provider for parents and children. 

It was the habit of some people during Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance) to kill their children for fear of poverty. Thus, Allah (Exalted be He) prohibited His slaves from doing this crime, because it constitutes injustice, transgression, and thinking ill of Allah (Exalted be He). Then He (Exalted be He) prohibited approaching indecency, whether apparent or hidden; namely, all types of sins. He (Exalted be He) put special emphasis on the crime of killing someone without right due to the grievousness of this crime and the evil consequences that result from it that exceeds all other sin, except Shirk. Afterwards, He (Exalted be He) prohibited approaching the property of an orphan except in the way that is best; that is when the orphan reaches maturity, comes of age, and starts understanding life. 

Moreover, Allah (Exalted be He) commanded giving full measure with fairness and justice because being dishonest with measure and weighing is injustice and transgression. It amounts to devouring property unjustly. Then He (Exalted be He) commanded fairness in speech after He commanded justice in action. He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "And whenever you give your word (i.e. judge between men or give evidence), say the truth even if a near relative is concerned" [Al-An'am: 152] The meaning is that justice should be practiced in all words and actions with relatives and strangers, and people we like and dislike, out of obedience to Allah (Exalted be He) and implementing His Law. The opposite of justice is injustice in words and actions. Then He (Exalted be He) commanded His slaves to fulfill His covenant which He has taken from them, as mentioned in His manifest Book and from His trustworthy Messenger (peace be upon him). This covenant comprises all that Allah (Exalted be He) has legislated for His slaves, such as obligations, rulings, words, actions, prohibitions, as stated by the eminent Mufassirs (exegetes of the Qur'an). Afterwards, He (Exalted and Glorified be He) says: "And verily, this (i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path" [Al-An'am: 153], so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. It becomes clear that the Path of Allah is acting in accordance with His Commands, keeping away from His Prohibitions and believing inwardly and outwardly in all that His Messenger (peace be upon him) brought of useful knowledge, true information, legislation and rulings, as opposed to the hypocrites.

In Surah Al-Fatihah, Allah (Exalted be He) has guided His slaves to ask Him to guide them to His Path because of their great need for it. He (Exalted be He) explained that this path is the one of those upon whom Allah (Exalted be He) bestowed His Favors; those mentioned in His Words (Exalted be He): "And whoso obey Allâh and the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), then they will be in the company of those on whom Allâh has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiqûn (those followers of the Prophets who were first and foremost to believe in them, like Abu Bakr As-Siddîq (رضي الله عنه), the martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are!" [Al-Nisa: 69]

The Hadiths ranked as Marfu' (a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with a connected or disconnected chain of narration), the narrations of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and the Tabi'un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) proved that the path which is prohibited to be followed is that of Bid'ahs (innovations in the religion), doubtful matters, prohibited desires, erroneous doctrines and creeds, and false religions. For example, it is reported by Imam Ahmad and Al-Nasa'y through good Isnad (chain of narrators), on the authority of 'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him), that he said: "**The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) drew a line with his hand and then said, 'This is the Path of Allah; it is straight.' Then he (peace be upon him) drew other lines on its right and left side and then said, 'These are the other paths. All these paths have a devil on it inviting people to it.' Then he (peace be upon him) recited, "And verily, this (i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path." [Al-An'am: 153]**" [^3]
