## What is Salafiyyah?
Salafiyyah is a term derived from the word “Salaf”, which refers to the righteous predecessors of the first three generations of Muslims which include the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet), Tabi‘un (the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and Tabi‘ Al-Tabi‘un (the generation after the Tabi‘un). The Messenger of Allah attested to their righteousness when he said: "**The best of people are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people whose testimony will precede their oath and their oath will precede their testimony.**" [^1]

## Who are the Salafis?
The word “Salafis” is the plural of “Salafi”, derived from “Salaf” that has the above-mentioned meaning. It refers to those following the way of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the early Muslim generation in their adherence to the Qur‘an and the Sunnah and calling people to believe and act upon them, and thereby became known as “Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah.”

## Who are the Salaf?
“Salaf” are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) who are the followers of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) such as the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) and those who follow in their footsteps until the Day of Resurrection (cf. Qur’an 9:100). When the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about Al-Firqah Al-Najiyah (the Saved Sect), he said: “**Those who follow the very same that I and my Companions follow today.**” [^2]

## Who are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah
Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama’ah are the Muslims who follow the very same way which Prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah (peace be upon him) and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) followed.

## What is the fundamentals and principles of the Salafi da’wah?
The Salafi call (Da’wah) is a call to follow the footsteps of the Messenger (peace be upon him), his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them), and those who follow them in righteousness, with wisdom, fair preaching, and arguing in the best way along with struggling with one’s soul to act accordingly toward all that the person is calling for
