<p>
  Muslims have to avoid bid'ahs (religious innovations) and beware of them for the Prophet ﷺ said, "He who does an act which we have not commanded, will have it rejected (by Allah)." and he ﷺ also said, "Avoid novelties [in religion], for every novelty is a bid'ah, and every bid'ah is deviation."
