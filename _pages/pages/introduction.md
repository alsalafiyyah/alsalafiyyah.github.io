- Firstly, this Shari'ah is fully established by Allah, and needs no human to complete it, as Allah states, "**This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.**" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3). 
- Secondly, the fundamental rule on the acts of 'Ibadah (worship) is that it is Tawqifiyyah (bound by a religious text from the Qur'an and Sunnah, and not subject to personal opinion). Whoever claims that an 'Ibadah is legitimate should provide evidence to support it; otherwise, it is rejected. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ stated, "**He who innovates something in this matter of ours (i.e., Islam) that is not of it will have it rejected (by Allah).**" In another narration, "**He who does an act which we have not commanded, will have it rejected (by Allah)**" 
- Thirdly, as for the meaning of Bid`ah (innovation in religion), linguistically it means creating something new, with no previous example to follow; while in Shari'ah it means innovating a form of verbal, practical, or creedal ibadah which is not legislated by Allah (Praised and Exalted be He). Every Bid'ah leads to misguidance, according to what the Prophet ﷺ stated.
