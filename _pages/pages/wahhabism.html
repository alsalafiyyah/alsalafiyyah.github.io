<p>Wahhabism is the term which the enemies of Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab gave to his dawah to purify Tawhid (monotheism) from all forms of Shirk (polytheism) and to renounce all the ways except that of Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdullah (peace and blessinga be upon him). Their intention was to alienate people from his dawah and obstruct it. </p>
