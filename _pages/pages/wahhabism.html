  Wahhabism is the term which 
  the enemies of Shaykh Muhammad ibn 
  ‘Abdul-Wahhab gave to his da'wah to 
  purify Tawhid (monotheism) from all 
  forms of Shirk (polytheism) and to 
  renounce all the ways except that 
  of Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdullah (peace 
  and blessings be upon him). Their 
  intention was to alienate people 
  from his dawah and obstruct it. 
  Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab 
  was a follower of Quran and Sunnah, 
  and he was one of the renewers and 
  reformers who called the ummah to 
  come back to the Quran and Sunnah 
  and to follow the example of the 
  righteous salaf (may Allah be 
  pleased with them). He did not 
  introduce anything new from himself, 
  rather he called people to the Quran 
  and Sunnah.
