- First, this Shari'ah is fully established by Allah, and needs no human to complete it, as Allah states, "**This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.**" (Surah Al-Ma'idah, 5: 3). 
- Second, the fundamental rule on the acts of 'Ibadah (worship) is that it is Tawqifiyyah (bound by a religious text and not subject to personal opinion). Whoever claims that an 'Ibadah is legitimate should provide evidence to support it; otherwise, it is rejected. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stated, "**Whoever introduces something into this affair of ours which is not of, it will be rejected.**" In another narration, "**Whoever performs any act which is not in accordance with our command, it is to be rejected.**" 
- Third, as for the meaning of Bid`ah (innovation in religion), linguistically it means creating something new, with no previous example to follow; while in Shari'ah it means innovating a form of verbal, practical, or creedal ibadah which is not legislated by Allah (Praised and Exalted be He). Every Bid'ah leads to misguidance, according to what the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated. 
- Fourth, as for dividing Bid'ah in religion into five categories, this is groundless in Shari'ah. We recommend that you refer to the book entitled "Al-I'tisam" by Al-Shatibi, where he speaks about Bida' in an incomparable way; "Al-Sunan wal-Mubtada'at", "Al-Ibda' fi Madarr Al-Ibtida'", and "Tanbih Al-Ghafilin" by Al-Nahhas; "Zad Al-Mi'ad" by the great scholar Ibn Al-Qayyim, and "Iqtida' Al-Sirat Al-Mustaqim" by the Sheikh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah. 
- Fifth, the word "every" does not denote exclusion, but inclusion as stated in the science of Usul-ul-Fiqh (principles of Islamic jurisprudence).
