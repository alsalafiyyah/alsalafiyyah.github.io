His Eminence Shaykh Ibrahim ibn Muhammad ibn Ibrahim ibn 'Abdul-Latif ibn 'Abdul-Rahman ibn Hasan ibn Imam Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Wahhab

### His Birth:

Shaykh Ibrahim ibn Muhammad Al Al-Shaykh was born in 1344 A.H.

### His Education:

Shaykh Ibrahim memorized the Ever-Glorious Qur'an during his childhood at the schools of 'Abdullah ibn Mufayrij (may Allah be merciful to him) and 'Aly ibn 'Abdullah Al-Yamany. He studied the science of Tajwid (reciting the Qur'an following the rules of recitation) under the tutelage of Shaykh Sa'ad Waqqas (may Allah be merciful to him) in Makkah. He accompanied his father (may Allah be merciful to him) to the learning circles where he studied jurisprudence, Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism), and grammar. He then joined the Educational Institute and graduated from the college of Shari'ah in Riyadh in 1376 A.H. Then he was appointed as director of the Department of Ifta', and later as deputy to the Mufty. After the death of his father (may Allah be merciful to him), Shaykh Ibrahim was chosen as the Chairman of the General Presidency for Ifta' and the Supervision of Religious Affairs, which was later organized and renamed as the Presidency of the Departments of Scholarly Research, Ifta', Da'wah, and Guidance. He remained Chairman for six years, during which the Council of Senior Scholars was established and he was chosen to be a member of it and as the Chairman of the Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta'. He also presided over the awareness campaigns during Hajj for several years.

### His Shaykhs:

He acquired knowledge from his father and many Shaykhs, including His Eminence Shaykh 'Abdul-Aziz ibn 'Abdullah ibn Baz, His Eminence Shaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Al-Shanqyty (may Allah be merciful to him), and many others. He supervised the work of both the preachers abroad and the guides inside the Kingdom. He was nominated as Minister of Justice. After the death of His Eminence Shaykh 'Abdullah ibn Hamid, Chief Justice of the Supreme Council of Justice, (may Allah be merciful to him), Shaykh Ibrahim was appointed as Acting Chief Justice. He followed up and supervised the work of the judges and notaries public, with the result that justice was served well during his time and many Shar'i courts were opened across the Kingdom.

He participated in many Islamic conferences and exerted much effort in urging people to adhere to, apply, and substitute the Islamic Shari'ah for the positive laws in Islamic countries. He participated in many of the various committees in the country. Having performed many services for the country for a long period of time, he asked the ruler – may Allah protect him – to retire him due to his health conditions in late 1409 A.H.

He was characterized as having good morals and a commitment to doing good for the people. He died (may Allah be merciful to him) on Thursday, 22 Rabi' Al-Awwal, 1428 A.H.
