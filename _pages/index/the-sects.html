Imam Ibn Al-Mubarak (may Allah have mercy on him) said: "The roots of the seventy-two sects are four: the Khawarij, the Rafidah (Shi'ah), the Qadariyah and the Murji’ah." It was said to Ibn Al-Mubarak, "And the Jahmiyyah?" he (may Allah have mercy on him) said, "the Jahmiyyah are not part of the ummah of Muhammad ﷺ." [Quoted by Shaykhul Islam Ibn Taymiyyah in his book: Majmu’ Al-Fatawa 35/414]
