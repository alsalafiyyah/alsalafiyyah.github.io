These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance –both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book– were upon, which the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad, peace be upon him) opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. 

This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarifed. 

The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith in the heart, for what the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad, peace be upon him) came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allah says: **“And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allah, it is they who are the losers.”** (al-Ankabut [29]:52). 

**[1]** They performed worship by mixing righteous people into their supplication and worship of Allah. They only did this desiring that these (righteous people) act as intercessors for them before Allah, based on their notion that Allah loved this and that these righteous people loved Him. 

Allah says: **“And they worship besides Allah things that harm them not nor proft them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah.”** (Yunus [10]: 18)

And He (Glory be to Him, the Exalted) says: **“And those who take associates apart from Him, (say): We worship them only so that they may bring us nearer to Allah.”** (az-Zumar [39]: 3)

This is the greatest of matters that the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad, peace be upon him) opposed them in. So he brought sincerity (i.e.,, doing deeds sincerely for Allah alone and not for anyone else) and informed that it was the Religion of Allah, which all the messengers were sent with. And he informed us that no deeds are accepted (by Allah), except those done sincerely (for Him alone). 

And he (peace be upon him) informed that whosoever does what these (polytheists) approved of, and then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him and his fnal destination will be the Hellfre. It is due to this aspect that mankind becomes divided into Muslims and disbelievers. And it is due to it that enmity (between the two) occurs. And it is for this purpose that Jihad was legislated, as Allah says: **“And fght them (disbelievers) until there is no more Fitnah (evil/disbelief) left, and the religion is for Allah alone.”** (al-Anfal [8]: 39) 

**[2]** They divided into sects within their religion. 

Allah says: **“And do not be among the polytheists –of those who split up their religion and became divided into sects– each sect rejoicing in that which it has.”** (ar-Rum [30]: 32). 

They also split up into divisions with regard to their worldly affairs, and they saw that as being the correct thing to do. So Allah prescribed unity and agreement in the Religion, saying: **“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and Isa, (saying): You should establish the Religion and make no divisions within it.”** (ash-Shura [42]: 13) 

And He says: **“Verily, those who split up their religion and became sects; you have no concern with them in the least.”** (al-An'am [6]: 159) 

He has forbidden us from being similar to them, saying: **“And be not like those who split up and differed after the clear signs came to them.”** (Aal-'Imran [3]: 105) 

And He has forbidden us from splitting up into sects in the Religion: **“And hold frmly onto the Rope of Allah, all of you together, and be not divided.”** (Aal-'Imran [3]: 103).

**[3]** They held the acts of opposing the fgure of authority and failing to comply with him as being something virtuous. And they saw the acts of hearing and obeying as being humiliating and degrading. So the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad, peace be upon him) opposed them and commanded that patience be observed when facing the oppression of the rulers. And he commanded with hearing and obeying them, as well as advising (them). And he (peace be upon him) spoke extensively in regards to that and he constantly brought it up and repeated it. 

These (first) three aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) have been gathered together in what has been related on the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad, peace be upon him) in Sahihayn (the two Sahih i.e., Bukhari & Muslim), that he said: **“Indeed, Allah is pleased with three things for you: That you not worship (anything else) except Allah and that you not associate anything with Him; that all of you, together, hold tightly onto the Rope of Allah and not be divided into groups, and; that you mutually advise he whom Allah has given authority over your affairs.”** There did not occur any defects in the religious and worldly affairs of mankind, except that it was due to a violation of these (first) three aspects, or one of them. 

**[4]** Their religion was built upon certain principles, the greatest of which was taqlid (blind following). 

So this was the biggest principle for all of the disbelievers –the frst and last of them– as Allah says: **“And similarly, We sent not a warner before you (Muhammad) to any town (people), except that the luxurious ones among them said: Verily, we found our forefathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow in their footsteps.”** (az-Zukhruf [43]: 23) 

And He says: **“And when it is said to them: Follow that which Allah has sent down! They say: Nay, we shall follow that which we found our forefathers (following). Would they do so even if the Devil invites them to the torment of the Fire?”** (Luqman [31]: 21) 

So He revealed to them His saying: **“Say: I exhort you to one thing only –that you stand up for Allah’s sake in pairs and singly– and then refect (upon the life of the Prophet). There is no madness in your companion (Muhammad (peace be upon him)).”** (as-Saba [34]: 46) 

And His saying: **“(Say to the disbelievers): Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any partners besides Him. Little do you remember!”** (al-A’raf [7]: 3)

**[5]** From their greatest principles was that they were deceived by (following) the majority, using that as a proof against the correctness of a matter. And they also used as evidence for declaring the falsehood of something, the fact that it was strange and that its adherents were few. So Allah prescribed the opposite of that and He clarifed this in many places of the Qur'an.

**[6]** They relied upon (the actions of) their ancestors as evidence (for their doings), as is found in His saying: **“Then what about the generations of old?”** (Ta-Ha [20]51) 

And His saying: **“We never heard of this thing (which you have brought), amongst (the speech of) our forefathers.”** (al-Mu’minun [23]: 24)

**[7]** They would use as a basis of proof that any people that had been given strength in understanding and works, as well as in dominion, wealth and status; that they were upon the truth. So Allah refuted that by saying: **“And indeed We had frmly established them (disbelievers of old) with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraysh)!”** (al-Ahqaf [46]: 26) 

And saying: **“Although aforetime, they had invoked Allah (for the coming of Muhammad) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved. Then when there came to them that which they recognized (i.e.,, the Prophet), they disbelieved in him.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 89) 

And saying: **“Those who have been given the Scripture recognize him (Muhammad) as they recognize their own sons.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 146)

**[8]** They used as evidence for determining the falsehood of a matter, the fact that only the weak ones followed it, as is found in Allah's saying: **“They said: Shall we follow you, when the lowliest of people follow you?”** (ash-Shuara [26]: 111) 

And He says (relating their statements): **“Is it these (poor believers) whom Allah has favored from amongst us?”** (al-An'am [6]: 53) So Allah refuted this claim, saying: **“Should not Allah know best those who are grateful?”** (al-An'am [6]: 53)

**[9]** They followed and took their example from their evil and wicked scholars and worshipers. So Allah revealed His saying: **“O you who believe! Verily, there are many of the (Jewish) rabbis and (Christian) monks that take the wealth of mankind unjustly and hinder them (mankind) from the way of Allah.”** (at-Tawbah [31]: 34) 

And His saying: **“Do not go to extremes in your religion (by believing in something) other than the truth. And do not follow the vain desires of people that went astray, from times of past, and who misled many and strayed (themselves) from the Right Path.”** (al-Ma’idah [5]: 77)

**[10]** They used the following argument for determining the falsehood of a religion that the ones who followed it possessed a short amount of understanding and lacked good memory, as Allah says: **“They followed you without thinking.”** (Hud [11]: 27)

**[11]** They used a wicked and corrupt type of reasoning to establish evidence, as occurs in His saying: **“You are no more than human beings like us!”** (Ibrahim [14]: 10)

**[12]** They rejected the correct and true way of reasoning. The reason for the occurrence of this aspect and the one before it was due to a lack of understanding, on their part, of (what consisted of) similarities and differences (i.e., similarities and differences between the prophets and normal human beings).

**[13]** They went to extremes with regard to their scholars and righteous people, as is found in His saying: **“O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your religion (by exceeding the limits set forth by Allah). And do not speak concerning Allah, except that which is true.”** (an-Nisa [4]: 171) 

**[14]** Everything that has been mentioned previously is based upon a principle, which is denying and affrming (i.e., they denied what Allah affrmed and affrmed what Allah denied). So they followed vain desires and speculation while turning away from what Allah revealed to them.

**[15]** They used the claim that they had a **“lack of comprehending”** as an excuse for not following what Allah revealed to them, as Allah says: **“(They said): Our hearts are sealed (with coverings).”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 88) 

And He says: **“(They said): O Shuayb (Jethro), we do not understand much of what you say!”** (Hud [11]: 91) 

So Allah declared them to be liars and clarifed that their lack of understanding was due to the sealing of their hearts, and the sealing of their hearts was due to their disbelief.

**[16]** They replaced what came to them from Allah with books of magic, as Allah mentions in His saying: **“And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confrming what was with them, a party of those who were given the scripture threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they did not know! And they followed (instead) what the devils gave out (falsely of magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 101-102)

**[17]** They ascribed their falsehood to the prophets, as is found in Allah’s saying: **“And Sulayman (Solomon) did not disbelieve.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 102) and His saying: **“Ibrahim (Abraham) was neither a Jew nor a Christian.”** (Aal 'Imran [3]: 67)

**[18]** They contradicted themselves in their ascriptions, for they would ascribe themselves to Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), yet openly manifest their lack of following him.

**[19]** They slandered and accused righteous people based on the actions of others who “ascribed” themselves to these (righteous people). An example of this is found in the Jews' slander of 'Isa (Jesus) and the Christians' and Jews' slander of Muhammad ﷺ. 

**[20]** They believed that the tricks of the sorcerers and their likes were from the miraculous endowments that Allah granted to some righteous people. And they attributed it to the prophets, such as their ascribing it to Sulayman (Solomon, peace be upon him).

**[21]** They performed worship by whistling and clapping their hands.[^1]

**22]** They took their Religion as an amusement and a game. [^2]

**[23]** They were deluded by the life of this world. So they perceived Allah’s bestowal of worldly material (on someone), as an indication of He was pleased (with that person), as He says: **“And they say: We are abundant in wealth and in children. And (because of that) we are not going to be punished.”** (Saba [34]: 35)

**[24]** They refused to enter into the truth when they saw that they had already been preceded to it by the weak and poor -out of pride and disdain- so Allah revealed: **“And turn not away those who invoke their Lord, morning and afternoon seeking His Face.”** (al-An'am [6]: 52). 

**[25]** They determined the truth to be false based upon their argument that the weak and poor people took precedence in accepting it. This is as He says: **“(They said): Had it (i.e., Islam) been something good, they (poor and weak ones) would not have preceded us in (accepting) it.”** (al-Ahqaf [46]: 11) 

**[26]** They distorted (i.e., Tahrif) the Book of Allah after having comprehended it, while doing so knowingly (i.e., deliberately and not out of ignorance). 

**[27]** They authored books of falsehood and then attributed them to Allah, as is found in His saying: **“Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say: This is from Allah.”** (al-Baqarah [2]79) 

#### Rejecting the Truth found with others
**[28]** They did not accept anything from the truth, except for that which was (in accordance) with their party/group. Allah says: **“And when it is said to them (Jews): Believe in what Allah has sent down! They say: We will believe in (only) what was sent down to us. And they disbelieved in that which came after it; whereas it is the truth confrming what is with them.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 91).

#### Not Acting on the Views of those whom they claimed to Follow
**[29]** But in spite of this, they did not even have knowledge of what the party/group (that they adhered to) used to believe, as Allah points out in His saying: **"Then why have you killed the prophets of Allah aforetime, if you indeed were believers?"** (al-Baqarah [2]: 91)

#### Adhering to Division and Abandoning Unity 
**[30]** It is from the amazing signs of Allah that when these people abandoned the command of Allah to unite and began to commit that which Allah forbade from evil, the matter became such as: **"Each group rejoicing in that which it has."**

#### Enmity towards the True Religion and Love for the False Religion
**[31]** It is also from the amazing signs of Allah that these people held the highest degree of hatred for the religion they affliated themselves with, while having love for the religion of the disbelievers; those who were enemies to them and their prophet. 

And their trial was found in the extent of their love (for that religion of their enemies). As they did with the Messenger of Allah (Muhammad, peace be upon him). when they approached him with the religion of Musa (Moses, peace be upon him), while (in reality) they were following the books of magic. And that (magic) was from the religion of the people of Pharaoh.

#### Denying the Truth when it was with Others whom they did not Like.
**[32]** They disbelieved in the truth if it was found with someone that they did not like or agree with. Allah says: **"The Jews say that the Christians follow nothing (i.e., are on the wrong Religion) and the Christians say that the Jews follow nothing."** (al-Baqarah [2]: 113)

#### Contradictions in Affrming and Denying
**[33]** They rejected what they agreed was part of their Religion, as they did during the Hajj (pilgrimage) to the House (i.e., the Ka’bah). Allah says: **"And who turns away from the religion of Ibrahim (pure Tawhid), except he who fools himself."** (al-Baqarah [2]: 130). 

#### Each Sect Praise itself apart from Others 
**[34]** Every one of (their) groups claimed that they were the saved one. So Allah declared them to be liars with His saying: **"Bring forth your proof if you are indeed truthful.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 111) Then He clarifes what is correct, saying: **"Rather, whosoever submits himself to Allah while he is a good-doer, his reward is with Allah.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 112). 

#### Seeking Nearness to Allah by Committing the Prohibited 
**[35]** They performed their acts of worship while exposing their private parts, as Allah says: **"And when they committed an evil deed (i.e., going around the Ka’bah in a naked state), they said: We found our forefathers doing it.”** (al-A’raf [7]: 28). 

#### Seeking Nearness to Allah by Prohibiting the Lawful and Permitting the Unlawful 
**[36]** They performed worship by forbidding the lawful, in the same manner that they worshiped by ascribing partners to Allah.

#### Taking the Rabbis and Monks as Lords besides Allah 
**[37]** They observed their worship by taking their rabbis and monks (i.e., learned people) as lords besides Allah.

#### Denying Allah's Names and Attributes
**[38]** They denied Allah's Attributes, as Allah says: **"But you thought that Allah did not know much of what you were doing."** (Fussilat [41]: 122)

#### Denying Allah's Names 
**[39]** They denied Allah's Names, as Allah says: **"While they disbelieve in ar-Rahman (The Most Merciful)."** (ar-Ra’d [13]: 30)

**[40]** They committed Ta’til (negation of Allah's Names and Attributes), as is found in the statement of the people of Pharaoh.

**[41]** They attributed defciencies to Allah, such as (Him having) a child, a need and being tired, while (on the other hand), they would eliminate some of these defciencies from their religious leaders (i.e., monks).

**[42]** They committed Shirk in Allah's sovereignty (mulk), as is found in the beliefs of the Majus. 

**[43]** They rejected al-Qadar (Divine Pre-ordainment).

**[44]** They used al-Qadar as an excuse (for themselves) against Allah.

**[45]** They opposed Allah's Legislation (i.e., commandments) by using His Divine Pre-ordainment (as an argument).

**[46]** They reviled time as is found in their saying: **"There is nothing but our life of this world. We die and we live and nothing destroys us except ad-Dahr (time)."** (al-Jathiyah [45]: 24)

**[47]** They attributed Allah's blessings to someone other than Him, as He says: **"They recognize the blessings of Allah, yet they deny them (by worshiping others besides Allah)."** (an-Nahl [16]: 83)

**[48]** They disbelieved in the signs of Allah.

**[49]** They rejected some of them (these signs).

**[50]** They said: **"Allah did not send down anything to a man."** (al-An'am [6]: 91) 

**[51]** They said about the Qur’an: **"Verily, this is nothing but the word of a man."** (al-Muddaththir [74]:;25)

**[52]** They attacked the wisdom of Allah, the Mighty.

**[53]** They employed different schemes –both hidden and apparent– to repel what the messengers came with. This is as is found in His saying: **"And they (disbelievers) plotted, while Allah (too) plotted."** (Aal 'Imran [3]: 54) 

And His saying: **"And a party of the people of the Scripture say: Believe in the morning in that which is revealed to the believers, and reject it at the end of the day, so that they may turn back."** (Aal 'Imran [3]: 72)

**[54]** They agreed with the truth in order to fnd a way to repel it, as Allah has stated in the aforementioned verse.

**[55]** They held fanaticism for a particular Madhhab (i.e., belief, school of thought), as is found in His saying concerning that (quoting from the disbelievers): **“And do not believe (in anyone), except he who follows your religion (way of thinking).”** (Aal 'Imran [3]: 73)

**[56]** They labeled the aspect of following Islam as being a form of Shirk (association of partners in the worship of Allah). This has been mentioned by Allah in His saying: **“It is not possible for a human being that Allah give him the Book, the rule and the prophethood and then he (turns around after that) saying to the people: Be my worshipers, rather than Allah's. On the contrary, (he would say): Be you Rabbaniyyun (learned religious men) because of your having taught and studied the Book. Nor would he order you to take angels and prophets as lords (i.e., gods). Would He order you to disbelieve after you have submitted to Allah's Will?”** (Aal 'Imran [3]: 79-80)

**[57]** They distorted (Allah’s) words from their original state (i.e., meanings). 

**[58]** They twisted (the meanings of) the words found in the Book.

**[59]** They labeled the people of guidance with evil names such as “Sabian” (one who apostates from the truth) and “Hashawi” (one without any beneft in his speech).

**[60]** They fabricated lies upon Allah.

**[61]** They disbelieved in the truth.

**[62]** They held the condition that, whenever overcome by established proof (against them), they fed to complain to the king (or ruler), as Allah says: **"The chiefs of the people of Pharaoh said (to Pharaoh): Will you leave Musa and his people to spread mischief in the land?"** (al-A'raf [7]: 127)

**[63]** They accused them (i.e., the prophets who refuted them) of causing mischief in the land, as is stated in the (previous) verse. 

**[64]** They accused them of defaming and belittling the religion of the king (or ruler), as Allah says: **“The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Will you leave Musa and his people to spread mischief in the land and to abandon you and your gods."** (al-A'raf [7]: 127) 

And He says (quoting Pharaoh): **“Verily, I fear that he will change your religion.”** (Ghafr [40]: 26) 

**[65]** They accused them of defaming and belittling the (false) gods of the king, as is stated in the (previous) verse.

**[66]** They accused them of changing the Religion, as Allah says: **“Verily, I fear that he will change your religion or that mischief and evil will spread throughout the land.”** (Ghafr [40]: 26) 

**[67]** They accused them of defaming and belittling the king (ruler), as Allah says: **“The chiefs of Pharaoh's people said: Will you leave Musa and his people to spread mischief in the land and to abandon you and your gods."** (al-A'raf [7]: 127)

**[68]** They claimed that they acted upon what was with them from the truth, as is found in His saying: **“They say: We will believe in what was sent down to us.”** (al- Baqarah [2]: 91), while (in reality) they abandoned it.

**[69]** They would make additions to their acts of worship (by innovating into them), as was done by them on the day of Ashura. 

**[70]** They would (on the other hand) make decreases in their worship also, as was done in their abandonment of stopping at the mountain of Arafat.

**[71]** They abandoned performing obligatory matters out of (false) piety.

**[72]* They performed worship by forsaking the good things that were bestowed unto them (by Allah). 

**[73]** They performed worship by abandoning the beautifcation of Allah.

**[74]** They called the people towards misguidance, without any knowledge.

**[75]** They called the people towards disbelief, while knowing.

**[76]** They would plot powerful plots (against the prophets), as was done by the people of Nuh (Noah, peace be upon him).

**[77]** Their leaders consisted of two types: Either he was an evil scholar; or he was an ignorant worshiper. This is as Allah says: **"Do you (believers) covet that they (Jewish Rabbis) will believe in your religion, in spite of the fact that a party of them (Rabbis) used to hear the word of Allah (i.e., Tawrah), then they used to change it knowingly after they had understood it. And when they (Jews) meet those who believe (Muslims), they say: We believe. But when they meet one another in privacy, they say: Shall you (Jews) tell them (Muslims) what Allah as revealed to you, so that they may argue with you about it before their Lord. Have you (Jews) then no understanding? Know they not that Allah knows what they conceal and what they reveal. And there are among them (Jewish Rabbis), unlettered people who know not the Book, but they trust upon false desires and they but guess."** (al-Baqarah [2]: 75-78)

**[78]** They claimed that they were the Awliya (friends/supporters) of Allah apart from all other people.

**[79]** They claimed to love Allah, while they abandoned His Divine Laws. So Allah tested them, saying: **“Say (O Muhammad): If you truly love Allah, then follow me, Allah will love you and forgive you your sins.”** (Aal 'Imran [3]: 31)

**[80]** They held onto false hopes, such as their saying: **"The Hellfre will not touch us, except for a limited number of days.”** (al-Baqarah 2/80) And their saying: **"None shall enter Paradise unless he is a Jew or a Christian."** (al-Baqarah [2]: 111)

**[81]** They took the graves of their prophets and righteous people as places of worship (Masajid).

**[82]** They took the landmarks of their prophets (i.e., places where they had sat or prayed in) as places of worship, as has been narrated on 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him).

**[83]** They placed lamps upon the graves.

**[84]** They took these places (grave sites) as locations for celebrating holidays.

**[85]** They performed sacrifces at the grave sites.

**[86]** They glorifed the landmarks and relics of their (deceased) prestigious and revered ones, such as was the case with the central town meeting hall (Dar an-Nadwah). Those who were in its power used to brag and boast about it, as it was said to Hakim bin Hazzaam (when he sold Dar an-Nadwah): “You have sold the honor of Quraysh.” So he said: “All honor has passed away except that of piety (Taqwa).”

**[87]** They boasted and were prideful about their family descent.

**[88]** They reviled (people’s) chains of lineage.

**[89]** They sought the expectation of rain from (determining it through) the constellations of stars (not from Allah).

**[90]** Their women would wail and lament for the deceased. 

**[91]** The most honorable of their virtues was showing transgression to others by challenging them. So Allah revealed concerning it, what He revealed.

**[92]** The most honorable of their virtues, also, was bragging and boasting, even when they had a right to do so. So Allah forbade that.

**[93]** Holding individual fanaticism and zealotry for one's party/group whether they were upon truth or falsehood was a must according to them. So Allah revealed what He did concerning that matter.

**[94]** Their religion consisted of holding people accountable for the crimes of others. So Allah revealed: **"And no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another."** (al-An'am [6]: 164)

**[95]** They used to condemn a person due to what was found in someone else. This is seen in the Prophet’s saying (to Abu Dharr when he argued with Bilal and called him 'son of a black woman'): "Do you condemn him because of his mother? Indeed you are a man who has in him, (aspects of) Jaahiliyyah (the Days of Ignorance)!"

**[96]** They bragged and boasted that they were the caretakers of the House (of Allah, i.e., the Ka’bah). So Allah rebuked them, saying: **"In pride, they (Quraysh used to feel pride that they were the dwellers of the Makkah sanctuary) talked evil about it (the Qur'an) by night."** (al-Mu’minun [23]: 67)

**[97]** They would boast about their condition of being from among the offspring of the prophets. So Allah revealed His saying: **“That was a nation that has passed away. They shall receive the reward of what they earned and you of what you earned."** (al-Baqarah [2]: 134)

**[98]** They would boast about their trades, just as the merchants do considering themselves above the farmers.

**[99]** The worldly life was glorifed in their hearts, as is found in His saying: **“And they say: Why is this Qur'an not sent down to some great man of the two towns (Makkah and Taif)?**  (az-Zukhruf [43]: 31)

**[100]** They made suggestions above Allah’s doings, as is seen in His (above) saying. 

**[101]** They looked down upon the poor folk. So Allah revealed His saying: **"And turn not away those who invoke their Lord morning and afternoon, seeking His Face."** (al-An'am [6]: 52)

**[102]** They accused those who followed the messengers of having a lack of sincerity and of desiring to achieve worldly ends. So Allah responded to them by saying: **“You are accountable for them in nothing."** (al-An'am [6]: 52) and other similar statements. 

**[103]** They disbelieved in the angels. 

**[104]** They disbelieved in the messengers (sent by Allah). 

**[105]** They disbelieved in the revealed books (of Allah). 

**[106]** They turned away from (accepting) what was reported concerning Allah. 

**[107]** They disbelieved in the Last Day.
