These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance –both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book– were upon, which Rasulullah [^1] ﷺ opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarifed. 

The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith in the heart, for what Rasulullah ﷺ came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allah says: **“And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allah, it is they who are the losers.”** (al-Ankabut [29]:52). 

**[1]** They performed worship by mixing righteous people into their supplication and worship of Allah. They only did this desiring that these (righteous people) act as intercessors for them before Allah, based on their notion that Allah loved this and that these righteous people loved Him. 

Allah says: **“And they worship besides Allah things that harm them not nor proft them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah.”** (Yunus [10]: 18)

And He (subhanahu wa ta'ala [^2]) says: **“And those who take associates apart from Him, (say): We worship them only so that they may bring us nearer to Allah.”** (az-Zumar [39]: 3)

This is the greatest of matters that Rasulullah ﷺ opposed them in. So he brought sincerity (i.e.,, doing deeds sincerely for Allah alone and not for anyone else) and informed that it was the Religion of Allah, which all the messengers were sent with. And he informed us that no deeds are accepted (by Allah), except those done sincerely (for Him alone). And he ﷺ informed that whosoever does what these (polytheists) approved of, and then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him and his fnal destination will be the Hellfre. It is due to this aspect that mankind becomes divided into Muslims and disbelievers. And it is due to it that enmity (between the two) occurs. And it is for this purpose that Jihad was legislated, as Allah says: **“And fght them (disbelievers) until there is no more Fitnah (evil/disbelief) left, and the religion is for Allah alone.”** (al-Anfal [8]: 39) 

**[2]** They divided into sects within their religion. 

Allah says: **“And do not be among the polytheists –of those who split up their religion and became divided into sects– each sect rejoicing in that which it has.”** (ar-Rum [30]: 32). 

They also split up into divisions with regard to their worldly affairs, and they saw that as being the correct thing to do. So Allah prescribed unity and agreement in the Religion, saying: **“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and Isa, (saying): You should establish the Religion and make no divisions within it.”** (ash-Shura [42]: 13) 

And He says: **“Verily, those who split up their religion and became sects; you have no concern with them in the least.”** (al-An'am [6]: 159) 

He has forbidden us from being similar to them, saying: **“And be not like those who split up and differed after the clear signs came to them.”** (Aal-'Imran [3]: 105) 

And He has forbidden us from splitting up into sects in the Religion: **“And hold frmly onto the Rope of Allah, all of you together, and be not divided.”** (Aal-'Imran [3]: 103).

**[3]** They held the acts of opposing the fgure of authority and failing to comply with him as being something virtuous. And they saw the acts of hearing and obeying as being humiliating and degrading. So Rasulullah ﷺ opposed them and commanded that patience be observed when facing the oppression of the rulers. And he commanded with hearing and obeying them, as well as advising (them). And he ﷺ spoke extensively in regards to that and he constantly brought it up and repeated it. 

These (first) three aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) have been gathered together in what has been related on Rasulullah ﷺ in Sahihayn (the two Sahih i.e., Bukhari & Muslim), that he said: **“Indeed, Allah is pleased with three things for you: That you not worship (anything else) except Allah and that you not associate anything with Him; that all of you, together, hold tightly onto the Rope of Allah and not be divided into groups, and; that you mutually advise he whom Allah has given authority over your affairs.”** There did not occur any defects in the religious and worldly affairs of mankind, except that it was due to a violation of these (first) three aspects, or one of them. 

**[4]** Their religion was built upon certain principles, the greatest of which was taqlid (blind following). 

So this was the biggest principle for all of the disbelievers –the frst and last of them– as Allah says: **“And similarly, We sent not a warner before you (Muhammad) to any town (people), except that the luxurious ones among them said: Verily, we found our forefathers following a certain way and religion, and we will indeed follow in their footsteps.”** (az-Zukhruf [43]: 23) 

And He says: **“And when it is said to them: Follow that which Allah has sent down! They say: Nay, we shall follow that which we found our forefathers (following). Would they do so even if the Devil invites them to the torment of the Fire?”** (Luqman [31]: 21) 

So He revealed to them His saying: **“Say: I exhort you to one thing only –that you stand up for Allah’s sake in pairs and singly– and then refect (upon the life of the Prophet). There is no madness in your companion (Muhammad).”** (as-Saba [34]: 46) 

And His saying: **“(Say to the disbelievers): Follow what has been sent down unto you from your Lord, and follow not any partners besides Him. Little do you remember!”** (al-A’raf [7]: 3)

**[5]** From their greatest principles was that they were deceived by (following) the majority, using that as a proof against the correctness of a matter. And they also used as evidence for declaring the falsehood of something, the fact that it was strange and that its adherents were few. So Allah prescribed the opposite of that and He clarifed this in many places of the Qur'an.

**[6]** They relied upon (the actions of) their ancestors as evidence (for their doings), as is found in His saying: **“Then what about the generations of old?”** (Ta-Ha [20]51) 

And His saying: **“We never heard of this thing (which you have brought), amongst (the speech of) our forefathers.”** (al-Mu’minun [23]: 24)

**[7]** They would use as a basis of proof that any people that had been given strength in understanding and works, as well as in dominion, wealth and status; that they were upon the truth. So Allah refuted that by saying: **“And indeed We had frmly established them (disbelievers of old) with that wherewith We have not established you (O Quraysh)!”** (al-Ahqaf [46]: 26) 

And saying: **“Although aforetime, they had invoked Allah (for the coming of Muhammad) in order to gain victory over those who disbelieved. Then when there came to them that which they recognized (i.e.,, the Prophet), they disbelieved in him.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 89) 

And saying: **“Those who have been given the Scripture recognize him (Muhammad) as they recognize their own sons.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 146)

**[8]** They used as evidence for determining the falsehood of a matter, the fact that only the weak ones followed it, as is found in Allah's saying: **“They said: Shall we follow you, when the lowliest of people follow you?”** (ash-Shuara [26]: 111) 

And He says (relating their statements): **“Is it these (poor believers) whom Allah has favored from amongst us?”** (al-An'am [6]: 53) So Allah refuted this claim, saying: **“Should not Allah know best those who are grateful?”** (al-An'am [6]: 53)

**[9]** They followed and took their example from their evil and wicked scholars and worshipers. So Allah revealed His saying: **“O you who believe! Verily, there are many of the (Jewish) rabbis and (Christian) monks that take the wealth of mankind unjustly and hinder them (mankind) from the way of Allah.”** (at-Tawbah [31]: 34) 

And His saying: **“Do not go to extremes in your religion (by believing in something) other than the truth. And do not follow the vain desires of people that went astray, from times of past, and who misled many and strayed (themselves) from the Right Path.”** (al-Ma’idah [5]: 77)

**[10]** They used the following argument for determining the falsehood of a religion that the ones who followed it possessed a short amount of understanding and lacked good memory, as Allah says: **“They followed you without thinking.”** (Hud [11]: 27)

**[11]** They used a wicked and corrupt type of reasoning to establish evidence, as occurs in His saying: **“You are no more than human beings like us!”** (Ibrahim [14]: 10)

**[12]** They rejected the correct and true way of reasoning. The reason for the occurrence of this aspect and the one before it was due to a lack of understanding, on their part, of (what consisted of) similarities and differences (i.e., similarities and differences between the prophets and normal human beings).

**[13]** They went to extremes with regard to their scholars and righteous people, as is found in His saying: **“O People of the Book! Do not go to extremes in your religion (by exceeding the limits set forth by Allah). And do not speak concerning Allah, except that which is true.”** (an-Nisa [4]: 171) 

**[14]** Everything that has been mentioned previously is based upon a principle, which is denying and affrming (i.e., they denied what Allah affrmed and affrmed what Allah denied). So they followed vain desires and speculation while turning away from what Allah revealed to them.

**[15]** They used the claim that they had a **“lack of comprehending”** as an excuse for not following what Allah revealed to them, as Allah says: **“(They said): Our hearts are sealed (with coverings).”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 88) 

And He says: **“(They said): O Shuayb[^3], we do not understand much of what you say!”** (Hud [11]: 91) 

So Allah declared them to be liars and clarifed that their lack of understanding was due to the sealing of their hearts, and the sealing of their hearts was due to their disbelief.

**[16]** They replaced what came to them from Allah with books of magic, as Allah mentions in His saying: **“And when there came to them a Messenger from Allah confrming what was with them, a party of those who were given the scripture threw the Book of Allah behind their backs, as if they did not know! And they followed (instead) what the devils gave out (falsely of magic) in the lifetime of Sulayman.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 101-102)

**[17]** They ascribed their falsehood to the prophets, as is found in Allah’s saying: **“And Sulayman[^4] did not disbelieve.”** (al-Baqarah [2]: 102) and His saying: **“Ibrahim[^5] was neither a Jew nor a Christian.”** (Aal 'Imran [3]: 67)

**[18]** They contradicted themselves in their ascriptions, for they would ascribe themselves to Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him), yet openly manifest their lack of following him.

**[19]** They slandered and accused righteous people based on the actions of others who “ascribed” themselves to these (righteous people). An example of this is found in the Jews' slander of Isa[^6] (Jesus, peace be upon him) and the Christians' and Jews' slander of Muhammad ﷺ. 

**[20]** They believed that the tricks of the sorcerers and their likes were from the miraculous endowments that Allah granted to some righteous people. And they attributed it to the prophets, such as their ascribing it to Sulayman (Solomon, peace be upon him).
