Question: 
 
Is it permissible for a Muslim to enter a church to know of their prayers or listen to a lecture?

Answer:

A Muslim is not allowed to enter the places of worship of disbelievers as this leads to increasing their number. It was reported by Al-Bayhaqy with a sound chain of transmitters on the authority of `Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: "...And do not enter upon Mushrikun (those who associate others with Allah in worship) in their churches or temples as the wrath of Allah descends upon them." But if there is a legal benefit underlying the act or you do so for the sake of inviting them to Allah, there will be no blame on you.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
