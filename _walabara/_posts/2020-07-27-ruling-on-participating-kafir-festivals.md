Question: 

Is it permissible to attend their festivals?

Answer:

It is not permissible to participate in their festivals or congratulate them, for this conduct shows a kind of intimacy and endorsement of their rituals. It is also a forbidden collaboration with them in sin and aggression. Allah forbids this and having intimate relationships with them. Allah states, "**You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rûh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself. And He will admit them to Gardens (Paradise) under which rivers flow to dwell therein (forever). Allâh is pleased with them, and they with Him. They are the Party of Allâh. Verily, it is the Party of Allâh that will be the successful.**" [al-Mujadilah: 22]

Thus, a Muslim should detest and disassociate himself from them. Allah (Exalted be He) states, "Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: "**Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone"**" [al-Mumtahanah: 4]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
