Question: 

We want to import Swiss pocketknives on which the Swiss flag logo is inscribed. We would like you to inform us whether the logo represents a cross or a plus sign. Is it permissible to import such pocketknives on which such a logo is inscribed? Please, answer us, may Allah reward you well!
 
Answer:

It is not permissible to import pocketknives on which the logo referred to above, i.e. A cross, is inscribed. Actually, it involves propagating the Christian logo among Muslims. Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) ordered us not to copy them or propagate their rituals among Muslims. In this regard, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "Anyone who copies a people is one of them." [^1]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
