Question: 

What is the ruling on returning the greetings to Christians, attending their funerals, and offering condolences to them?

Answer:

A Muslim should return the greeting of a Non-Muslim by saying, "wa `alaykum" (same to you). It was authentically reported in a Hadith Sahih (authentic Hadith) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: "**When the People of the Book offer you salutations, you should say: The same to you.**" [^1]
"
It is not permissible for a Muslim to follow the funeral procession of a Non-Muslim, as it is Haram (prohibited) for a Muslim to take them as allies. However, it is permissible for a Muslim to offer condolences to non-Muslims when necessary by saying, "May Allah offer you the best condolence and relieve your ordeal". A Muslim should not add, "May Allah forgive the deceased" as it is not permissible to ask forgiveness for a Non-Muslim.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
