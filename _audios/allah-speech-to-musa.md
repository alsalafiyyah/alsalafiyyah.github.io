Question:

How many times did Allah speak to Musa (Moses, peace be upon him)? Did He speak to him at the same place where He first spoke to him, if this happened more than once? 

Answer:

Allah knows best, Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**and to Musa (Moses) Allah spoke directly.**" [Al-Nisa: 164] As for the number of times; Allah (Exalted be He) knows that best, as I do not know about the number of times.
