Question: 

A questioner asks: Is it true that the word 'Aqidah (belief) is incorrect and baseless, and that it is better to use the term Iman (faith) instead? 

Answer: 

This is incorrect. Scholars use the word 'Aqidah on matters related to one's inner belief, those related to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) as well as Allah's Attributes. There is no harm to say that so and so, for example, follows the 'Aqidah of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). It is called 'Aqidah because it means firm belief that is not liable to any doubt, as people are hung up on it.
