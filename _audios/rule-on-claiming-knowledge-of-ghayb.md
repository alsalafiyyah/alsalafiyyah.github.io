Question:

A sister asks: There is a man in our village who claims to have knowledge of the Ghayb (Unseen), the ability to harm and benefit people and cure the sick. People visit him to ask him to fulfill their needs. He says to them: "If you vow to the righteous people, such as Al-Husayn, 'Ali or Al-Abbas then you are obliged to fulfill this vow otherwise you will be afflicted with a great punishment." People do as this man tells them without hesitation as they fear him a lot. He offers vows to other than Allah and says: "I am depending on Al-Abbas as he talks to me and tells me the truth, because I am a righteous man." When the people hear this, they tremble with fear from his anger. Please advise and guide us, may Allah reward you with the best!

Answer:

This man who claims that he has knowledge of the Ghayb and that Al-Abbas talks and informs him of everything, and sees that vowing to Al-Husayn, 'Ali or any other dead person is a form of getting closer to them, this person is a Kafir (disbeliever) who has gone astray and leads people astray. People should not pay attention to him, rely on him or fear him, for he is a swindler and a charlatan who is of no benefit and who uses these words to intimidate and scare the general public to take their money unlawfully by deceiving them. This person should be reported to the authorities in charge of these matters in order for him to abandon his wrongdoings and to be punished for his mischievous deeds. He should be asked to perform Tawbah (repentance); if he repents, all is well and good, otherwise he is subject to capital punishment as a Kafir.
