Question: 

Are parents of children under ten considered sinners if their children do not perform Salah (Prayer)?

Answer: 

No! They are not sinners. They should only encourage thern to perform it. However, when children reach ten years old, it is Wajib (obligatory) to command them to offer Salah and admonish them lightly if they are negligent until they comply. As for children who are between seven and ten, it is permissible for parents to only urge them (without punishment).
