Question: 

I have read a lot about the theory that humans evolved from an ape-like ancestor. The theory proposes that humans went through several stages until they developed into the modern man. Is this true? Are the organs of apes similar to those of humans? Please advise us, may Allah reward you with the best! 

Answer: 

This statement is false, unacceptable, and contradictory to the Book of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), the Sunnah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) as well as the Ijma' (consensus) of the Salaf (righteous predecessors). This theory which was introduced by Darwin is proven to be a lie, for modern humans originated from a human ancestry, not from an ape or anything else. Allah created our father Adam (peace be upon him) from clay. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, "**And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth).**" [Al-Mu'minun: 12]

Allah created Adam from clay and molded him in His Image. Adam was sixty cubits tall, but people have been decreasing in stature since then. He was created in the form and shape of today humans. His children were created in his image; they have ears, eyes, minds, and the same shape of today human. They stand upright, they speak, hear and see, and they can use their hands. 

They do not have the form of apes and do not share apes the same organs. Human beings are of a special origin as are apes, pigs, dogs, donkeys, cats, etc. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states, "**There is not a moving (living) creature on earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but are communities like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book, then unto their Lord they (all) shall be gathered.**" [Al-An'am: 38]

These communities will be gathered on the Day of Resurrection to have the scores among them settled and it will be said to them, 'Be dust'.

On the other hand, Jinn and mankind will be called to account and will be rewarded according to their deeds; whoever obeys Allah will enter Jannah (Paradise) and whoever disbelieves in Him will enter the Hellfire. These communities are distinct species; apes are a species that have their own nature, form, and characteristics, and so are the pigs, dogs, donkeys, camels, cows, sheep, etc. Each of these species has its own shape and characteristics which Allah (Exalted be He) molded. He is the All-Wise and All-Knowing of the minute details and formation of each species. A servant of Allah must believe that the creation of Adam differs from the creation of apes and the form of Adam is the same as that of today's man and not as apes or anything else. The claim that man descended from an apelike ancestor is false and unacceptable. 

Therefore, it is correct to assume that anyone who espouses this theory is a Kafir (disbeliever). The most correct view is that whoever believes this theory while knowing the ruling of Shari'ah in this regard is a Kafir and such a person then belie Allah, His Messenger and the Qur'an which gives a clear description of the creation of Adam.
