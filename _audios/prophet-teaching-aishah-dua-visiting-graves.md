Question: 

What is the degree of authenticity of the Hadith reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) in which he taught 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her), upon her request, a Du'a (supplication) to say when visiting graves? Is this a Hadith Sahih (a Hadith that has been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish)? Does this Hadith indicate the permissibility of women visiting graves? 

Answer: 

This Hadith is Sahih; however, this was during the period when it was permissible for both men and women to visit graves. At the beginning, the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade both men and women from visiting graves then they were all allowed. 

Later, women were forbidden from visiting graves and men were ordered to visit them. People were not allowed at the beginning, to visit graves because they were new in Islam. So, this was a way of protecting them against Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Later, the Prophet (peace be upon him) allowed visiting graves for all, 

Then, he (peace be upon him) forbade women from visiting graves and allowed men only. This Hadith in which he teaches 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) the Du'a of visiting graves was during the period when women were allowed to visit them along with men.
