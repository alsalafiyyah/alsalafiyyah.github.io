Question:

Abdullah Abu Omar from Jordan asks: In winter, my hands become very cold, can I wear woolen gloves while praying? Does this contradict (the rule that a praying person should prostrate) on the seven organs, including the hands? 

Answer:

There is nothing wrong with this. Wearing gloves is similar to wearing Khuffs (leather socks). All praise is due to Allah for this. If you wear gloves to keep your hands warm, or you wear Ghutrah (a traditional cotton headdress worn by men in some Arab countries), head cover, or Bisht (a traditional Arab men's flowing outer cloak), and so on, and you prostrate while wearing any of them, there is nothing wrong with this. All this is tolerated. The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) used to perform Sujud (prostration) over their clothes if the land was so hot.
