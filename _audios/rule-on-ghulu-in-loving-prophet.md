Question: 

What does Ghulu in loving the Prophet (peace be upon him) mean? 

Answer:

Ghulu (Exceeding proper limits) means an increase or doing something more than what is ordained by Allah (Exalted be He). The Arabic word 'ghala' (boil) denotes the rise of water because of fire. Therefore, Ghulu means exceeding proper limits by doing something more than what is legally ordained. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Be cautious against exceeding the proper limits in matters of religion. Those who were before you were devastated because of exceeding the proper limits in matters of religion.**" [Al-Nisa: 171]

Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**0 people of the Scripture (Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion**" 

Therefore, Ghulu means exceeding the proper limits in doing desirable acts that are legally ordained by Allah. This kind of behavior is called Ghulu. For example, Allah ordained Five Obligatory Daily Prayers and therefore it is impermissible to make them six by making make Salat-ul-Duha (supererogatory Prayer after sunrise) obligatory upon people. If you are a Sultan or prince, you may say that this increase by having a sixth Prayer is better. But this is impermissible and Ghulu. Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: "**Whoever does a deed that is not according to our way, his deeds will be rejected.**" 

You may say that you love the Prophet (peace be upon him) and you will invoke him beside Allah (Exalted be He) by asking him to cure your disease or grant you victory. This is Ghulu as it exceeds the proper limits. This is because you are ordained to invoke Allah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**...so let him make Du'a' (supplication) to Allah...**" He (peace be upon him) orders you to invoke Allah. He (peace be upon him) does not order you to invoke him. 

Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**Invoke Me, [i.e. believe in My Oneness (Islamic Monotheism)] (and ask Me for anything) I will respond to your (invocation).**" [Ghafir: 60]

Therefore, one should make Du'a to Allah (Exalted be He), not the Messenger (peace be upon him). Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allâh, any other ilâh (god), of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al-Kâfirûn (the disbelievers in Allâh and in the Oneness of Allâh, polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful.**" [Al-Mu'minun: 117]

Invoking anyone other than Allah like the dead, trees, stones or even the Prophet (peace be upon him) is major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). This is a kind of Ghulu. Moreover, doing more than what is ordained by Allah (Exalted be He) with regard to acts of Ibadah (worship) is a kind of Ghulu. Allah (Exalted be He) ordains for you to make Dua' to Him by his Names, Attributes and your righteous deeds. But making Dua' to Allah by the honor, the blessing or the virtue of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is a Bid'ah (innovation in religion) and a kind of Ghulu. 

Making Du'a to Allah (Exalted be He) by virtue of your righteous deeds like loving and believing in the Prophet (peace be upon him) is permissible and legal. But, it is impermissible to make Du'a' to Allah (Exalted be He) by the virtue of the Prophet (peace be upon him) or by his blessings. It is permissible only to make Dua' to Allah by one's love, belief, obedience and following the guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him). This is the legal Dua'. You can make Du'a' to Allah by His Names and Attributes or by believing in Him and His Messenger.
