Question:

Are those who worship graves excused because of their ignorance, even though among them are people calling to Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism)?

Answer:

They are not excused and they are obligated to acquire knowledge of the religion and learn more about it. They should inquire about what they are unsure of. This is a mandatory duty. If they remain quiet and continue to worship the dead, the trees, the stones, the prophets, the angels, or the jinn, they become Kafirs; through making Du'a to such things, or asking them for Shafa'ah (intercession), healing, or bringing back long lost or absent people, and so on.
