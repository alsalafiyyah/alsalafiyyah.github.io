Question: 

How can Muslims rectify and preserve their Islamic Aqidah (creed)?

Answer: 

'Aqidah can be rectified and preserved by seeking good understanding of Din (religion of Islam) and by referring to scholars who are well-grounded in religious knowledge (i.e. Scholars). The Muslim who seeks knowledge must ponder over the Ayahs (verses) of the Qur'an and the words of the Hadiths. Only in this way can a Muslim realize the true meaning of 'Aqidah as depicted in the Qur'an. Once the Muslim understands the true Islamic 'Aqidah, they should hold fast to it and follow it to the letter. Whenever ambiguity arises, they should refer to trustworthy and reliable scholars who can clarify ambiguous religious issues.
