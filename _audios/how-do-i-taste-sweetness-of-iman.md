Question: 

How do I taste the sweetness of Iman (faith)?

Answer: 

Turn to Allah, paying a lot of attention to your worship and making your heart present in your worship, think about and ponder on Allah's Sublimity and His Kindness, and remember Jannah (Paradise) and Hellfire and death. These are all means to acquire sweetness in Iman. Enjoy the pleasure of invoking Allah, through reciting the Qur'an and making Du'a (supplication) upon recalling the Greatness of Allah and departure from this world. Upon contemplating these matters and recalling Allah's Greatness, that He watches us, Khushu' (the heart being submissively attuned to the act of worship) grows in the hearts.
