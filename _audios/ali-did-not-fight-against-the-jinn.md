Question:

A questioner from Republic of Yemen asks: is it true that Imam Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) fought the Jinn (creatures created from fire)? It is narrated in book "**The battles of Imam 'Ali**" that he fought them until he  sent them down to the seventh earth. What is your opinion on this book? 

Answer: 

All of this is baseless. He did not fight the Jinn and no such thing happened at all. Rather this is false and is one of the lies and fabrications that people have invented. On this subject, Shaykh Al-Islam Abu'l-Abbas Ibn Taymiyah said: "**It is a lie which has no origin; rather it is one of the false stories fabricated by the liars.**"
