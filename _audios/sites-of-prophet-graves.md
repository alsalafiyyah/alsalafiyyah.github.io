Question: 

In the Sultanate of Oman, particularly in the South, there is a Masjid (mosque) and a grave in the mountain of Zhafar. The people of Zhafar claim that it is the grave of Prophet Ayyub. People visit the grave and travel to it in groups. A similar grave exists in Salalah and people claim that it is the grave of Imran. Likewise, people make it a place to frequent. Would you please comment on these actions and publicize the ruling on the radio? May Allah reward you with the best! 

Answer: 

These claims have no basis, for the sites of the graves of all prophets are unknown, except the grave of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) which is in Madinah and the grave of Prophet Ibrahim in Khalil. 

As for the graves of all other prophets, they are unknown to the scholars. Therefore, those who claim that these are prophets' graves should not be believed. They are neither the grave of Ayyub nor any other prophet (peace be upon them). If we were to assume that they are the graves of Ayyub and 'Imran or others, it is not permitted for anyone to worship these graves or supplicate to their dwellers beside Allah. 

It is not even permissible for anyone to supplicate to Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him), who is the best of all creatures, or to seek help from him, offer him vows or sacrifices, or draw close to him by means of slaughtered animals. All these acts are major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam). 

It is Wajib (obligatory) to beware of this. Dwellers of graves must not be worshipped along with Allah. One must not supplicate to them, seek help from them, or offer them vows and sacrifices. All these acts are major Shirk. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And your Lord has decreed that you worship none but Him.**" [Al-Isra: 23]

And: "**You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything).**" [Al-Fatihah: 5]

And: "**And invoke not besides Allah, any that will neither profit you, nor hurt you, but if (in case) you did so, you shall certainly be one of the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers).**" [Yunus: 106]

And: "**Such is Allah your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the thin membrane over the date-stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call, and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad SAW) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of each and everything).**" [Fatir: 13-14]

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) makes it clear that supplicating to other than Him, such as the dead, idols, trees, or stones, is Shirk. That is why He says: "**And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them.**" [Fatir: 14] This means they will disown you and blame you for your deeds. 

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And whoever invokes (or worships), besides Allah, any other ilah (god), of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord. Surely! Al-Kafirun (the disbelievers in Allah and in the Oneness of Allah, polytheists, pagans, idolaters, etc.) will not be successful.**" [Al-Mu'minun: 117] Allah describes those who invoke idols or the dead beside Him as Kafirs (disbelievers).

Muslims are obliged to beware of these acts of Shirk. They must advise one another to reject them and inform the ignorant of this ruling. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has obligated His Servants to recommend one another to Al-Haqq (the Truth) and the Way of Allah. Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**By Al-'Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss. Except those who believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth (i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma'which Allah has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar which Allah has forbidden), and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allah's Cause during preaching His religion of Islamic Monotheism or Jihad, etc.).**" [Al-Asr: 1-3]

And: "**Invite (mankind, O Muhammad (peace be upon him)) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islam) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Inspiration and the Quran) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.**" [Al-Nahl: 125]

May Allah grant us success and guidance!
