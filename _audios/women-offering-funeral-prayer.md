Question: 

Is it permissible for women to offer Janazah (Funeral) Prayer, or not?

Answer: 

Yes, generally, it is Mashru' (Islamically prescribed) for any Muslim to offer Janazah Prayer, whether they are a man or a woman. A woman can join the Janazah Prayer in the Masjid (mosque), or offer it at home. It is reported that when Sa'd ibn Abu Waqqas (may Allah be pleased with him) died 'Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) and other women offered Janazah Prayer. It is impermissible for women to visit the graveyard, or to follow the funeral procession to the graveyard. There is no problem for a woman to offer Janazah Prayer in the Masjid, in a Musalla (place for Prayer), or in the home of the deceased's family.
