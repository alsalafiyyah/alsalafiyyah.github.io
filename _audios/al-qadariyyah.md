Question:

Who are the Magians of this Ummah, Shaykh Abdul-Aziz ?

Answer:

They are the denying Qadariyyah who deny fate and say that everything is predestined. It is a fact that Magians say that humanity has two gods; the god of light and the god of darkness. They say that the god of light created goodness, whereas the god of darkness created evil. Those who deny fate resemble Magians in that they associate partners along with Allah with regard to their actions. They claim they themselves create their actions, we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound! My advice to all Muslims is to avoid this subject of fate. 

The (Muslims) must believe in fate and never pursue such topics as innovators in Islam do. They have to believe in fate and submit to the fact that Allah has predestined all things, knows everything and keeps account of all things. A human being has free will through which he can choose whatever he wishes to do, however that which he chooses will not differ from what Allah (may He be Exalted and Glorified) has predestined.
