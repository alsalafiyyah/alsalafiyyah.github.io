Question: 

A questioner asks: Who was the first Prophet: Idris (Enoch) or Nuh (Noah, peace he 
upon them)? 

Answer: 

Nuh was the first Prophet to be sent when Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) appeared among the people. Before him was Adam (peace be upon him) who was the first  Prophet and Messenger and his descendants followed Islam for ten centuries. Then, when Shirk appeared, Allah sent Nuh to his people. Therefore, Nuh was the first Messenger sent to his people who had fallen into Shirk.
