Question: 

Please, illustrate to me the meaning of Islam.

Answer: 

Islam means total submission to Allah (Exalted be He) through belief in His Oneness, and showing subservient and servile obedience to Him. This is the meaning of Islam. The Arabic root word  'Aslama' means to show submission and surrender to someone and obey his commands. Accordingly, Islam means surrender and submission to Allah's Will by means of believing in His Oneness, being devoted to Him, obeying His commandments and abandoning what He has prohibited. Such is Islam, about which Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.**" [Aal Imran: 19]

Besides, a Muslims are thus called as they show complete submission to Allah and obey Him, abiding by His Commandments and refraining from what He has prohibited. Islam is also a name for all the Commandments of Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him), including Salah (Prayer), Sawm (fast), Zakah (obligatory charity), Hajj (pilgrimage), faith and so on. Such categories fall under Islam. In this regard, Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Truly, the religion with Allah is Islam.**" [Aal Imran: 19]

He (Exalted be He) also says: "**This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islam as your religion.**" [Al-Maidah: 3]

He (Glorified be He) also  says: "**And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.**" [Aal Imran: 85]

Therefore, a Muslim is a person who submits himself to Allah (Exalted be He) as far as words, practical behavior and belief are concerned. In other words, Islam stands for total submission to and abidance by His Commandments in all aspects of life.
