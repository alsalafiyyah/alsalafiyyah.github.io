Question:

There is a person who claims that the tombs of the prophets: 'Imran, Salih, Ayub, and Hud (peace be upon them) exist in our country; the Oman Sultanate, especially in the southern area, Sallalah, where tombs with these names exist. Is this right or not? 

Answer:

All tombs of prophets are unknown except that of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). As for those who claim that there are tombs of the prophets in Oman or any other country, they are liars. The true fact is that the tomb of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) exists in Madinah, and that the tomb of Al-Khalil (Ibrahim, Abraham, peace be upon him) exists in Palestine, and its place is well-known. As for other prophets, we do not know the place of their tombs such as that of Nuh, Hud, Salih, or others, except that of Ibrahim which exists in Al-Khalil city. What is meant is that the places of all of the prophets' tombs, except that of the two honorable prophets: Muhammad and Ibrahim, are unknown to us. 

The tomb of Muhammad (peace be upon him) exists in Madinah, a fact that is known by all the Muslims, also that of Ibrahim al-Khalil (Abraham, beloved, close elect of Allah) is known as it exists in Al-Magharah in Al-Khalil city. The scholars said that the places of the tombs of the other prophets are unknown.
