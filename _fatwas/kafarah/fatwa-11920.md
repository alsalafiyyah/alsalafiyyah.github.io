Question: 

On 7/12/1408 A.H., I was returning from Jizan to Fifa Mountains where my family lives, heading to my mother's house where my children were staying. I wanted to take my children with me to Jizan, but my mother opposed me and told me that the `Eid (Feast) is approaching, and she wanted me and my children to spend the `Eid with her, but I refused. She remained silent for a while, and then she said, "May Allah do what is best." I did not pay attention to those words. I took my wife and children, and we rode a small car. When I reached the foot of the mountain, they told me at the police station that there are floods in the valley, and they recommended that I should wait until the floods subside. However, I did not listen to them, and I continued my journey, thinking that there was no flood. When I reached the valley, the car was stuck, and the people kept on asking me to run away, as the flood is coming. My wife also tried to help me run away, and I kept on trying to get out of the car for fifteen minutes. However, the flood came, and I could not get all of my family out of the car. My wife and six of my children died in this tragic event. Please advise concerning what I should do in this case. May Allah reward you.
