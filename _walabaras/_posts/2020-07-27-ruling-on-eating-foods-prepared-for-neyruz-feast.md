Question: 
 
We know that it is not permissible to celebrate what is called Neyruz (Iranian new year holiday), as it is one of the feasts of the Magi. The question is: Is it permissible to eat the foods served at these feasts several days later?
 
Answer:

First: It is not permissible for a Muslim to observe any of the rituals of disbelief and Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), including the religious occasions such as festivals and others.

Second: It is not permissible to eat the food served at feasts and celebrations associated with Shirk and Bid`ah (innovation in Islam). This is a sort of participation with and approval for them as they are. A Muslim should be very keen to maintain his Islamic practices unblemished.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
