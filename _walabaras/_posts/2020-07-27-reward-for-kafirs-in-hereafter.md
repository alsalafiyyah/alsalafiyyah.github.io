Question: 

What is the ruling on a benevolent disbeliever who does good towards Muslims such as building a Masjid (mosque) for them and giving money to poor Muslims. Shall he enter Paradise for his benevolence?

Answer:

If a disbeliever does good for the Muslims, he is rewarded for this in this life; however, it is not a reason for him to enter Paradise. Entering Paradise is a reward for Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) and abiding by the Shari`ah (Islamic law).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
