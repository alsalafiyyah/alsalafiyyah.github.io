Question: 

Is it permissible to speak with non-Muslim females and male Kafirs (disbelievers)?

Answer:

It is permissible, if there is no fear of Fitnah (temptation), and only as much as is necessary.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
