Question: 

I live with ten colleagues of various nationalities, including nine Christians and one atheist. We have our main meal together on one table. The meal is prepared alternately by two students. Is it permissible to eat with them, bearing in mind that it is beyond my financial ability and student conditions to live alone?

Answer:

Shari'ah (Islamic law) is based on providing ease, tolerance and avoiding hardship. Thus, you may continue living with them as you cannot live alone. However, you must call them to Allah verbally and by setting an example for them through kind dealings with them. Who knows! Perhaps you will be a source of blessing for them.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
