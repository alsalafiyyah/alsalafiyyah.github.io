Question: 
 
A dispute arose among us over the judgment on a Muslim who wears a cross pendant, which is a symbol of Christianity. Some maintain that such a person is a disbeliever with no need to discuss his reasons for wearing it. Others maintain that such a person should not be judged a disbeliever until he has been discussed and it has been made clear to him that wearing a cross is Haram for a Muslim and that it is a symbol of Christianity. If he still insists on wearing it, he will be regarded as a disbeliever.

Answer:

This matter and the like must be detailed and made clear. This person should be informed of the ruling on wearing the cross and that it is a symbol of Christianity. Moreover, he should be informed that wearing a cross is an indication of being satisfied with and belonging to the Christians and their beliefs. If he insists on the act, he will be regarded as a disbeliever. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, "And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust)." [al-Maidah: 51] When the word "Zâlimûn" is mentioned in the Qur'an without specification, it denotes Al-Shirk-ul-Akbar (major form of associating others in worship with Allah).

Additionally, wearing a cross is an acknowledgement of the Christians dogma of the crucifixion of `Isa (Jesus) (peace be upon him), which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) refutes in His Glorious Book, saying, "...but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ‘Isâ (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)]" (Surah Al-Nisa', 4:157)

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
