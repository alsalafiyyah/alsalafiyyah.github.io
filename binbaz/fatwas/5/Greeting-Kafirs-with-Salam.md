# Greeting kafirs with Salam

##### Question: 

Nowadays and due to coexistence with Westerners and Easterners, we find that Kafirs (non-Muslims) give Salam (Islamic greeting of peace) whenever they meet Muslims. What should we do in this regard? A questioner from Riyadh asks this question.       


##### Answer: 


It was authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "Do not initiate greetings of Salam with the Jews and the Christians, and if you meet them in the street push them towards the narrowest part of it." (Related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book). 



The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "When the People of the Book greet you with Salam, then say: ‘Wa ‘alaykum (and also upon you).’" (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). 



The People of the Book are the Jews and the Christians. The rest of the Kafirs have the same ruling of the Jews and Christians in this matter, since there is no difference in this respect between them as we know.



Muslims should not start greeting Kafirs with Salam at all. However, when Kafirs start offering Salam, Muslims should reply by saying "Wa ‘alaykum", acting upon the command of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). There is no wrong in saying after that, "How are you and your children?" This is held permissible by some of the scholars, including Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him), particularly if the Islamic interest necessitates so, such as making them interested in Islam so as to accept the Da`wah (calling to Islam) and listen to it. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better." [an-Nahl: 125] 



"And argue not with the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), unless it be in (a way) that is better (with good words and in good manner, inviting them to Islâmic Monotheism with His Verses), except with such of them as do wrong." [al-'Ankabut: 46]]
