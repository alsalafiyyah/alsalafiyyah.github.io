Question: 

Nowadays, there are a group of people who transfer the deceased months or years after burying them claiming that this deceased person came to one of them in a dream and said: "You have to build a shrine for me". While transferring the deceased to his grave, some of them claim that the deceased is the one who directs them while they carry him to the places he wants to visit before his last burial and claim that the deceased flies in addition to other superstitions. It should be noted that this deceased may not have offered Salah (Prayer) or observed Sawm (Fasting) during his entire life or even performed any of the Islamic obligatory acts. I wish your Eminence would explain the legal ruling in this regard. 

Answer: 

Firstly: Transferring the deceased from one grave to another one is not permissible unless there is a necessity to do so according to the Islamic Shari'ah. 

Secondly: As for the vision or dream, it is not true but they are Satanic insinuations as well as the claim that the deceased directs them to special places to visit before his last burial in the grave which he determines and that he flies to these places, is a mere false allegation. It is against Allah's Way (of conducting affairs) and not a Karamah (an extraordinary event caused by Allah for or through a pious person) but a manipulation done by those who carry the deceased. 

Thirdly: Building domes over the graves is a Munkar (disapproved by Islamic Shari'ah) act which should not be done and what has been built, should be destroyed because the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade building anything on graves and ordered us to level the high graves.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
