Question:

Is it permissible to cut down the harmful trees at the graves?

Answer:

They should be cut down because they harm the people who come to visit the graves. Similarly, any thorny plants should be cut down to spare the visitors the harm. Moreover, it is not permissible for anyone to plant any kind of trees or palm branches in the graveyard, for Allah (Exalted be He) has not prescribed this. Although the Prophet (peace be upon him) planted two palm stalks on the graves of two people whom he knew were being punished, he (peace be upon him) did not plant anything on the graves of Madinah or Baqi' (the graveyard of Madinah, near the Prophet’s Mosque). The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) did not do such a thing either. So, we know that this was only for the occupants of those two graves who were being punished. We ask Allah to grant us safety.
