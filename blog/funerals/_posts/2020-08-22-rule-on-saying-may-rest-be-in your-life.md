Question: 

Is it permissible to say to the family of the deceased: "May the rest be in your life"? What is the Islamic ruling regarding this?

Answer: 

This statement is frequently repeated by some people to convey their wishes that the addressee's life be long and full of goodness. However, the Sunnah (acts, sayings or approvals of the Prophet) is to offer condolences, and, supplicate for the deceased and his family in conformity with the way and words reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him). This benefits both the deceased and the living, as well as brings reward for the person offering condolences. It was narrated from Ibn Mas`ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Anyone who consoles a grief-stricken person will have a reward similar to his.**" (Related by Al-Tirmidhy and Ibn Majah) [^1]

May Allah grant us success. May peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!
