Question: 

Is it Haram (prohibited) to hang a photo in the home of one that died? Is it Haram to collect and keep photos of those who have passed away? 

Answer: 

It is impermissible to hang pictures of animate objects at home or elsewhere; whether they are living or dead people, and whether as memories or otherwise, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to `Ali (may Allah be pleased with him), "Spare no portrait from being effaced, and leave not a raised grave unleveled."" Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith.[1] It is impermissible for any other purpose.
 
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
