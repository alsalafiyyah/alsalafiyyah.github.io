Question: 

What is your opinion - may your favor continue - on setting up tents beside the graves, where Qur’an reciters keep reciting the Qur’an for a period of three days, then they grant the reward of the recitation to the deceased person? Is this act permissible and commendable, so that one will be rewarded by offering it? The second part is concerned with the reciters who keep reciting the Qur’an for three days, then take a wage for their recitation. Is this wage permissible? What if they are poor? Please provide us with the answer.

Answer: 

It is impermissible for anyone to set up a tent beside the grave where reciters keep reciting Qur’an, granting the reward to the dead, then taking a wage for their action.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
