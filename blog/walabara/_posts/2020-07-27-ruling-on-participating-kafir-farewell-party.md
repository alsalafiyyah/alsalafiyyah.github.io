Question: 

In our company, Muslim employees work together with Christian and Hindu employees. Some employees collect a sum of money from employees in order to hold a farewell party when one of the foreign employees is leaving. The party is composed of serving a meal plus a gift to the guest. Does a Muslim's participation with their money and selves in this kind of celebrations affect the Muslim's 'Aqidah (creed) in any way? Could you kindly advise? May Allah reward you!
 
Answer:

Muslims' participation with non-Muslims in collecting a sum of money to hold a party to see off non-Muslims is a kind of respect and honor to them which is not permissible for a Muslim to do or even take part in. It is obligatory to call non-Muslims to Islam, illustrate its beauty and draw it near to them perhaps Allah will guide them.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
