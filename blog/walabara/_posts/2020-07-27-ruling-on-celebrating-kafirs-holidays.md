Question: 

What is the ruling on Muslims who celebrate holidays of non-Muslims that Allah did not sanction, such as the Mother's Day, Sham Al-Nasim and Christmas?

Answer:

All these days are innovated celebrations which are not permissible for Muslims to participate in or celebrate. In Islam, there are only two 'Eids: 'Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast) and 'Eid-ul-Adha (the Festival of the Sacrifice). Thus, a Muslim whom Allah has guided to the truth should advise and gently instruct those who celebrate such innovated feasts. If he abandons this practice, it will be good; otherwise, he will be considered a persistent doer of Bid`ah (innovation in Islam) who is sinful for that action.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
