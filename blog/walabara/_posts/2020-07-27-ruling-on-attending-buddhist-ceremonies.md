Question: 
 
What is the ruling on Muslim's taking part in the celebrations held by the Buddhists for their dead, such as:
- A. Attending cremations
- B. Donations for these celebrations when not attending
- C. Giving black flowers to the bereaved family
- D. Wearing a black ribbon around the arm or the neck
- E. Visiting the homes of the bereaved relatives to offer condolences

Answer:

It is not permissible to do any of the things mentioned. In fact, doing them is Haram (prohibited), as it is sharing in their disbelief and helping them in what is not permissible in Islam.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
