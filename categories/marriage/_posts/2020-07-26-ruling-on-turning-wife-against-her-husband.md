Question: 

A woman's family is turning her against her husband, preventing her from going to him by force, and threatening her. Even more, they are asking him to divorce her. What is the ruling of Islam on people who do these acts nowadays? Please give us your Fatwa (legal opinion issued by a qualified Muslim scholar). May Allah reward you.

Answer:

It is Haram (prohibited) to turn a wife against her husband, based on the evidence reported in this regard. Anyone who does that has committed a sin and an evil act of Fisq (flagrant violation of Islamic law). 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
