Question: 

What is the ruling on a Muslim who reads the Bible or swears by it?

Answer:

It is not permissible for a Muslim to read the Bible as it has almost entirely undergone interpolation. Even the parts of the Bible that have undergone no interpolation are needless as the Qur'an replaces them. This ruling is not applicable to scholars who need to read it in order to refute the claims of the People of the Book. It is not permissible either to swear by the Bible in its present form as it has undergone partial interpolation and distortion, and thus cannot be the words of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
