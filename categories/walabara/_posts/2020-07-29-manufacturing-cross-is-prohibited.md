Question: 

What do you think about crosses printed on carpets in some Masjids (mosques)? A carpet spread in the Masjid may contain drawings of two crossing swords, a small palm tree and some crosses. How can a person offer Salah (Prayer) on these carpets?

Answer:

Making crosses is Haram (prohibited) whether they are three-dimensional, engravings, or mere drawings. It makes no difference whether these are drawn on walls, carpets, etc. It is not permissible to have crosses in Masjids (mosques), houses or educational buildings like schools, institutes and so on. Also, it is not permissible to keep crosses; they should be destroyed, removed, or changed either by breaking or distorting them. It is not permissible to sell or pray on carpets containing shapes of crosses.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
