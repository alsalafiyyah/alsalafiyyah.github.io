Question: 
 
Some foreign authorities distribute two types of flags, one for Saudi Arabia and the other one for their non-Muslim countries. A military official hangs these flags on people's chests. What is the ruling on this action?

Answer:

It is not permissible for a Muslim to hang the disbelievers' distinctive symbols, such as crosses or other items, onto their chest.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
