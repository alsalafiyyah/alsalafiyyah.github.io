Question: 

Sometimes I listen to some Christian radio programs only in order to know and learn about Christian thought. What is the Islamic view on this?
 
Answer:

It is not permissible to listen to Christian missionary programs, unless you have the basic knowledge that will make you sure of their absurdities and differentiate between truth and falsehood, in which case they cannot influence your beliefs and faith.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
