Question: 

Is it permissible for a Muslim to return lost property he finds which belongs to a disbeliever? Is it permissible for a Muslim to save a drowning disbeliever? Is it considered love of disbelievers to do so? May Allah reward you!

Answer:

First: It is obligatory on a Muslim to return the lost property of a disbeliever who is under Islamic protection if he finds it.

Second: It is permissible for a Muslim to save a drowning non-Harby (non-fighting against Muslims). It is part of dealing kindly with disbelievers to attempt to incline their hearts towards Islam. However, it does not fall under prohibited love of disbelievers.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
