Question: 
 
Does verbal or practical coercion justify professing Kufr (disbelief)?

Answer:

If coercion is actually existent, then the apparent declaration of disbelief is tolerated on condition that a person's heart is assured of faith, Allah (Exalted be He): "Whoever disbelieved in Allâh after his belief, except him who is forced thereto and whose heart is at rest with Faith; but such as open their breasts to disbelief, on them is wrath from Allâh, and theirs will be a great torment." [an-Nahl: 106]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
