Question: 

Is it permissible to keep company with a non-Muslim brother whom you called to accept Islam but he refused?

Answer:

You should not take him as a friend, if he refuses to accept Islam.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
