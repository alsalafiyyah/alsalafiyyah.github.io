Question: 

What is the ruling on a relative of a dead person sitting beside the grave when people leave after the burial for no more than half an hour?

Answer: 

It is impermissible Bid’ah (innovation in religion) that a relative of the deceased sits at the grave after burial for half an hour.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
