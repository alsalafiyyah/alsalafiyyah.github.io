  dua: May Allah guide us and all Muslims to useful knowledge and good deeds, grant us the ability to understand and follow the path of the master of the messengers, his Sahabah, and their followers in righteousness! May Allah protect us and all Muslims from the delusive trials, the insinuations of Satan, and from committing Bid'ah (innovations in Religion)! He is the One Who is capable to do so. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and his Companions!.
