Question:

Some claim that Takfir (declaring someone to be a disbeliever) that is known nowadays was the product of Shaykh Muhammad ibn 'Abdul-Wahhab's call. They also claim that some of his books, such as Kashf Al-Shubuhat and Al-Durar Al-Saniyyah, establish the approach to Takfir. What is Your Eminence's answer to those who make this claim? May Allah bless you.

Answer:

The Shaykh's call was free of these false accusations and lies that have been attributed to it. Takfir was not his approach to Da'wah (calling to Islam); rather, he called for good. As for the concept of Takfir, it is mentioned in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Verily, those who believe, then disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again) disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief; Allâh will not forgive them, nor guide them on the (Right) Way.**" [Al-Nisa’:137]

The Ever-Glorious Qur'an declares anyone who contradicts truth and right guidance to be a Kafir (disbeliever). Thus, there is evidence of Takfir in the Qur'an and Sunnah. Da'wah should only be based on clarifying the truth and always referring to the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Muslims only declare those who disbelieve in Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) to be Kafirs. In his book, Kashf Al-Shubuhat, the Shaykh points out and refutes the allegations of the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) at his time by referring to the allegations of early and later Mushriks and refuting them by citing evidence from the Qur'an and the Sunnah. Anyone who ponders on the book of Kashf Al-Shubuhat will recognize its sound and clear doctrine. 

The book of Al-Durar Al-Saniyyah contains treatises written by the Shaykhs of Najd and the Imams of guidance. They call for justice and goodness, and clarify the truth. A thorough and unprejudiced study of Al-Durar Al-Saniyyah and its treatises reveals the manifest truth, but those who are lacking in insight may recite the Qur'an and fail to understand it: "**Had Allâh known of any good in them, He would indeed have made them listen; and even if He had made them listen, they would but have turned away with aversion (to the truth).**" [Al-Anfal:23]
