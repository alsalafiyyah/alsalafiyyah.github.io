### Question: 
Some people claim that Ibn Taymiyyah does not belong to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). They further claim that he is astray and leading people astray. The same was adopted by Ibn Hajar (Al-Haythami) and other scholars. Is such a claim truthful or not?

### Answer: 
Undoubtedly, Shaykh Ahmad ibn ‘Abdul-Halim ibn Taymiyyah is one of the Imams of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama‘ah who called people to the truth and to the right path, through whom Allah supported the Sunnah and subdued the people of Bid‘ah (innovation in religion) and perversity. Thus, whoever judges Ibn Taymiyyah to be otherwise is the real heretic, who is astray and is leading people astray. The realities of things have become obscured to these people that they deem truth to be falsehood and falsehood to be truth. The truth is only known by those people whom Allah has enlightened, when they read the books of Ibn Taymiyyah and those of his opponents and compare his biography with theirs, which stand as the best witness and judge between the two parties.
