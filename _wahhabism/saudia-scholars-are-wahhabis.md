Question:

My parents are not upon the correct methodology and Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has guided me to the Qur'an and Sunnah upon the methodology of the Sahaabah but my parents are causing trouble for me and they claim that all of the scholars in Saudia are Wahhabis and that scholars of Saudia do not consider the four madhahib to be legitimate and they degrade them from their just position therefore it is not permissible to take knowledge from the scholars of Saudia, so how do we refute this shubhah?

Answer:

This is a lie. The scholars of Saudia do not make it haram to follow the four madhahib and they are taught in this land. The four madhahib are found, and they are taught and learnt, so this is batil (incorrect). Concerning the fatawa regarding the laws and giving the verdicts, they are based on the Hanbali Fiqh because that is the madhab of the leaders here and this is not something strange, because every nation follows a path and as long as this manhaj is not contradictory to the Quran and Sunnah then there is no problem with this. As for following all four madhahib in one area then this will cause confusion and disputes and splitting, so it is necessary that the methodology is one and followed in the same way, and the ways of teaching and learning are one way. The four madhahib are studies for their benefit and this is to know the proofs that they come with and to take the best opinion from between them. We take from the strongest saying even if it is in opposition to the Hanbali madhab. This is what was done before. What is important is to find the truth and follow it even if it is found in one of the other three madhahib.
