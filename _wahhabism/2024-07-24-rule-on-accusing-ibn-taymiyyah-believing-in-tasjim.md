### Question: 
Some of the beliefs that are common in our country say that the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) believed in Tajsim (anthropomorphism) and that he tried to prove that Allah (Exalted be He) has a body like humans. Moreover, people say that the Shaykh of Islam Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him) was a mischievous person; not a righteous one. He spread corruption in the Arab countries and he was astray and caused people to go astray. May Allah protect us from such beliefs. We are sending you two magazines (Nur Al-Yaqin and Al-Fajr Al-Sadiq) to check them.

### Answer: 
The Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and the Shaykh of Islam Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab were both Mujaddids (revivalist Muslim scholars), who revived the features of Islam that fell into oblivion in the light of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). They were both two of the scholars of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). Indeed, they were righteous; not mischievous. They were among those who proved the Names and Attributes of Allah (Exalted be He) as mentioned in the Qur'an and the authentic Sunnah in a manner that befits Allah (Glorified be He). 

Anyone who alleges that the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah believed in Tajsim is totally ignorant of the 'Aqidah (creed) of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah. Likewise, anyone who alleges that Shaykh Muhammad ibn Abdul-Wahhab was corrupt, not righteous, is ignorant of his 'Aqidah and the sincere Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) which he called to and which was consistent with the 'Aqidah of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah. May Allah be merciful with him, the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah, and all Muslim Imams.
