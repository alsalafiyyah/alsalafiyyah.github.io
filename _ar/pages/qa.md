## What is Salafiyyah?
Salafiyyah is a term derived from the word “Salaf”, which refers to the righteous predecessors of the first three generations of Muslims which include the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophetﷺ), at-Tabi‘un (the generation after the Companions of the Prophetﷺ) and Tabi‘ at-Tabi‘un (the generation after the Tabi‘un). The Messenger of Allah ﷺ attested to their righteousness when he ﷺ said: "**The best of people are my generation (or my century), then those who come after them, then those who come after them. Then there will come a people whose testimony will precede their oath and their oath will precede their testimony.**" [^1]. Salafiyyah is to follow the way of the Prophet ﷺ and his Companions, because they are the Salaf or the ones who came before us and who advanced ahead of us, so following them is Salafiyyah.

## Who are the Salafis?
The word “Salafis” is the plural of “Salafi”, derived from “Salaf” that has the above-mentioned meaning. It refers to those following the way of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the early Muslim generation in their adherence to the Qur‘an and the Sunnah and calling people to believe and act upon them, and thereby became known as “Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah.” [^2]

## Who are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah
Ahlus-Sunnah wal Jama’ah are the Muslims who follow the very same way which Prophet Muhammad ibn Abdullah ﷺ and his Companions (may Allah be pleased with them all) followed. [^3]

## Who are the Salaf?
“Salaf” are Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama’ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) who are the followers of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ such as the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophetﷺ) and those who follow in their footsteps until the Day of Resurrection (cf. Qur’an 9:100). When the Prophet ﷺ was asked about Al-Firqah Al-Najiyah (the Saved Sect), he ﷺ said: “**Those who follow the very same that I and my Companions follow today.**” [^4] [^5]

## What is the fundamentals and principles of the Salafi da’wah?
The Salafi da’wah is a call to follow the footsteps of the Messenger ﷺ, his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them), and those who follow them in righteousness, with wisdom, fair preaching, and arguing in the best way along with struggling with one’s soul to act accordingly toward all that the person is calling for. [^6]

## What is the difference between Aqidah and Manhaj
There is no difference between ‘Aqidah (creed) and Manhaj (methodology). Both terms refer to what a person believes in their hearts, confesses with their tongues, and acts accordingly with their bodily members. They encompass believing in the Oneness of Allah’s Lordship, Worship, His Names and Attributes, worshipping Him Alone, abiding by His Shari’ah in words and deeds, and following the Qur’an and the Sunnah as adopted by the Salaf (righteous predecessors) and Imams (initiators of Schools of Jurisprudence). Accordingly, there is no difference between ‘Aqidah and Manhaj; they refer to the same thing which all Muslims must observe and hold fast to. [^7]

## Shaykh Muhammad ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab
Shaykh Muhammad Ibn ‘Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be Merciful with him) was indeed one of the great callers to Salafiyyah (following the way of the righteous predecessors), and to the sound ‘Aqidah (creed) and the morally correct, upright method. His books abound with these aspects.The above-mentioned claim made by an antagonist to the Shaykh’s da'wah: that he deviated from the truth at the end of his life by denying authentic Hadiths that did not agree with his own views, is a lie fabricated against him. To the day he died, the Shaykh remained one of the strongest adherents to the Sunnah, and retained his deep veneration for it and kept calling people to it, may Allah be merciful to him. [^8]
