Question:

What is the best way to practice Da'wah (calling to Islam) with people who are influenced by certain cultures or communities?

Answer:

The Da'i (caller to Islam) must explain to them the defects and Bid'ahs (innovations in religion) in the schools which they have been influenced by, the orders which they have been affiliated to, and the milieus where they live. Also, the Da'i should clarify to them the acts which disagree with Shari`ah (Islamic law) and prevail in their communities and invite them to refer any disputable issue to the Qur'an and the Sunnah. If it agrees with both of them or even one of them, then it is recognized as Halal (lawful); if not, the originator of this act must be refuted whoever they are.

Muslim scholars used to refer disputable matters to Shari'ah-based evidence to consider what agrees with Shari'ah and discard what disagrees with it, even if its originator is a great person because the truth is above all. Likewise, it is obligatory to refrain from following any customs or manners that disagree with Shari'ah even if they were followed by forefathers, shaykhs, or ancestors. All Muslims must abide by the Commandments of Allah and His Messenger because this is the way to attain salvation. 

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And verily, this (i.e. Allâh’s Commandments mentioned in the above two Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so follow it, and follow not (other) paths, for they will separate you away from His Path. This He has ordained for you that you may become Al-Muttaqûn (the pious - see V.2:2).**"  [al-An'am: 153]

May Allah grant us success.
