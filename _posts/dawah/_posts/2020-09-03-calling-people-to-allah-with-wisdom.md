Question:

All the inhabitants of the village embraced Islam. But about half of the village have idols in their houses. We advised them to relinquish all these idols, but they refused. We entered every house in the village to destroy these idols by force. Fights broke out and led to the killing of one person. Is this Jihad? Is the dead person a martyr? 

Answer:

You have to call to Allah with wisdom, good admonition and arguing with people in the best manner. You should follow the command of Allah in His saying: "**Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching**" [al-Nahl: 125] 

You have to avoid violence and roughness against those whom you call to Islam. This behavior and way of preaching, such as destroying idols without having the authority to do so, drives people away from Islam. The only person who is permitted to destroy idols by force is the ruler in order to avoid mischief and chaos.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
