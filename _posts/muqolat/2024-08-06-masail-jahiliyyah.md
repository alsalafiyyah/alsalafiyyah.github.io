These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance –both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book– were upon, which Rasulullah ﷺ opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarifed. The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith in the heart, for what Rasulullah ﷺ came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allah says: “And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allah, it is they who are the losers.” (al-Ankabut 29/52). 

[1] They performed worship by mixing righteous people into their supplication and worship of Allah. They only did this desiring that these (righteous people) act as intercessors for them before Allah, based on their notion that Allah loved this and that these righteous people loved Him. 

Allah says: “And they worship besides Allah things that harm them not nor proft them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah.” (Yunus 10/18) 

And He (subhanahu wa ta'ala) says: “And those who take associates apart from Him, (say): We worship them only so that they may bring us nearer to Allah.” (az-Zumar 39/3) 

This is the greatest of matters that Rasulullah ﷺ opposed them in. So he brought sincerity (i.e.,, doing deeds sincerely for Allah alone and not for anyone else) and informed that it was the Religion of Allah, which all the messengers were sent with. And he informed us that no deeds are accepted (by Allah), except those done sincerely (for Him alone). And he ﷺ informed that whosoever does what these (polytheists) approved of, and then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him and his fnal destination will be the Hellfre. It is due to this aspect that mankind becomes divided into Muslims and disbelievers. And it is due to it that enmity (between the two) occurs. And it is for this purpose that Jihaad was legislated, as Allah says: “And fght them (disbelievers) until there is no more Fitnah (evil/disbelief) left, and the religion is for Allah alone.” (al-Anfal 8/39)
