These are the aspects that the people of the Days of Ignorance –both the people of the Book and the non-People of the Book– were upon, which Rasulullah ﷺ opposed. They are from the matters that every Muslim is required to possess knowledge of. This is since with (understanding) one side of the opposite, the goodness of the other side of the opposite can be made apparent. And it is by (making apparent the) opposite of something that matters become clarifed. The most important of these aspects (of the Days of Ignorance) and most severe in terms of danger was the absence of faith in the heart, for what Rasulullah ﷺ came with. And if approval for what the people of the Days of Ignorance were upon is further added to this (absence of faith), then the total ruin is achieved, as Allah says: **“And those who believe in the falsehood while disbelieving in Allah, it is they who are the losers.”** (al-Ankabut [29]:52). 

[1] They performed worship by mixing righteous people into their supplication and worship of Allah. They only did this desiring that these (righteous people) act as intercessors for them before Allah, based on their notion that Allah loved this and that these righteous people loved Him. 

Allah says: **“And they worship besides Allah things that harm them not nor proft them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah.”** (Yunus [10]: 18)

And He (subhanahu wa ta'ala) says: **“And those who take associates apart from Him, (say): We worship them only so that they may bring us nearer to Allah.”** (az-Zumar [39]: 3)

This is the greatest of matters that Rasulullah ﷺ opposed them in. So he brought sincerity (i.e.,, doing deeds sincerely for Allah alone and not for anyone else) and informed that it was the Religion of Allah, which all the messengers were sent with. And he informed us that no deeds are accepted (by Allah), except those done sincerely (for Him alone). And he ﷺ informed that whosoever does what these (polytheists) approved of, and then Allah has forbidden Paradise for him and his fnal destination will be the Hellfre. It is due to this aspect that mankind becomes divided into Muslims and disbelievers. And it is due to it that enmity (between the two) occurs. And it is for this purpose that Jihad was legislated, as Allah says: **“And fght them (disbelievers) until there is no more Fitnah (evil/disbelief) left, and the religion is for Allah alone.”** (al-Anfal [8]: 39) 

[2] They divided into sects within their religion. 

Allah says: **“And do not be among the polytheists –of those who split up their religion and became divided into sects– each sect rejoicing in that which it has.”** (ar-Rum [30]: 32). 

They also split up into divisions with regard to their worldly affairs, and they saw that as being the correct thing to do. So Allah prescribed unity and agreement in the Religion, saying: **“He has ordained for you the same religion which He ordained for Nuh and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim, Musa and Isa, (saying): You should establish the Religion and make no divisions within it.”** (ash-Shura [42]: 13) 

And He says: **“Verily, those who split up their religion and became sects; you have no concern with them in the least.”** (al-An'am [6]: 159) 

He has forbidden us from being similar to them, saying: **“And be not like those who split up and differed after the clear signs came to them.”** (Aal-'Imran [3]: 105) 

And He has forbidden us from splitting up into sects in the Religion: **“And hold frmly onto the Rope of Allah, all of you together, and be not divided.”** (Aal-'Imran [3]: 103).
