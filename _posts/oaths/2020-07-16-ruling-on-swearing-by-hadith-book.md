### Question: 
In our country, people are used to swearing by Al-Bukhari's Book of Hadith.  If a person loses hope in taking their right from their Muslim brothers, they make them swear by Al-Bukhari, not the Qur'an. If they swear by the Qur'an, they might lie with a clear conscience. However, if asked to swear by Al-Bukhari's Book of Hadith, they cannot lie. What is the ruling on those who swear by Al-Bukhari and refuse to swear by the Qur'an?

### Answer: 
Swearing, whether by the Qur'an or by Al-Bukhari's Book of Hadith is groundless in Shari`ah (Islamic law); it is done only by ignorant people. This habit should be stopped, and replaced with swearing by Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), not by the Qur'an, nor by Al-Bukhari's Book of Hadith or anything else.
