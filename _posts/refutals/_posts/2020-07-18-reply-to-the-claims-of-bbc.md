All Praise is due to Allah. May peace be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, and Companions.

Several days ago, I wrote an article containing a response to a question of the ruling on celebrating the Mawlid (the Prophet's birthday) in which I explained that celebrating the Mawlid is a Bid`ah (innovation in religion). The article was published in the local Saudi newspapers and broadcasted on the radio. Later on, I discovered that the BBC reported in its morning news that I said that celebrating the Mawlid is an act of Kufr (disbelief). So I have to explain the truth to the audience. The statement which the BBC reported from me on its morning news in London that I said that celebrating the Mawlid is an act of Kufr is a mere lie and groundless. Whoever reads my article will know that for sure. I feel terribly sorry that a worldwide broadcast like BBC that are widely respected by many people reports a mere lie like this. Undoubtedly, the audience must ascertain all the reported news lest it should contain lies as happened in this topic.

I ask Allah to protect us and all Muslims against lies and all that incurs the wrath of Allah, for He is the Most Generous. For the truth, the refutation has been published too. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions!
