excerpt: "A father should be fair with his sons and daughters according to the laws of inheritance. It is impermissible for him to dedicate any special thing to one of them unless the rest approve of it if they are of legal age, not out of fear, but willingly and without being threatened by their father."

Question: 

My father has an ancient house in an excellent location. He wants to register that house in my brother's name and I have agreed to this. However, I have sisters, and I asked my father about their share in that house. He told me that he has taken their consent. I am afraid that they have agreed out of shyness from our father. What is the ruling of Shari`ah (Islamic law) on this?

Answer: 

A father should be fair with his sons and daughters according to the laws of inheritance. It is impermissible for him to dedicate any special thing to one of them unless the rest approve of it if they are of legal age, not out of fear, but willingly and without being threatened by their father. However, it is better not to discriminate between them. This is according to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), "**Fear Allah and be just with your children.**" (Agreed upon) [^1].
