Question: 

What is the ruling on making Sujud (Prostration) and slaughtering for other than Allah out of ignorance? Is doing these acts ignorantly the same as doing them intentionally? 

Answer:

These acts fall into the matters the Muslim should not ignore. The doer of these acts is deemed a Kafir (disbeliever) and must perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah). Allah accepts a person whose Tawbah is sincere. On the day of the Liberation of Makkah, some Mushriks (persons who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) who were known for strong disbelief and misguidance performed Tawbah and Allah accepted it. 

As for the report that Mu'adh ibn Jabal prostrated himself before the Prophet (peace be upon him), it was allegorically interpreted and is regarded as acceptable. The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained to Mu'adh that his act is Haram (prohibited) and that the person should make Sujud only for Allah. [^1] Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**So fall you down in prostration to Allâh and worship Him (Alone).**" [Al-Najm:64] Mu'adh was ignorant of the ruling and the Prophet (peace be upon him) made it clear for him and all Muslims that Sujud is an exclusive right of Allah. He (Exalted be He) says: "**So fall you down in prostration to Allâh and worship Him (Alone).**" [Al-Najm: 62]

"**Say (O Muhammad peace be upon him): “Verily, my Salât (prayer), my sacrifice, my living, and my dying are for Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). “He has no partner.**" [Al-An'am: 162]

Thus, whoever makes Sujud for anyone or anything other than Allah is a Kafir and required to perform Tawbah.

[^1]: **Admin note**: Al-Tirmidhi [Book on breastfeeding] no. 1079: "When Mu‘adh arrived from Syria, he prostrated to the Prophet (peace be upon him) who said, “**What is this, O Mu‘adh?**” He said, “**I went to Syria and saw them prostrating to their archbishops and patriarchs, so I wished that we do the same for you.**" The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, “**Do not do that! If I were to command anyone to prostrate to other than Allah, I would have commanded the wife to prostrate to her husband.”**" -- Another Hadith narrates: He (peace be upon him) said to Mu‘adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him), “**Tell me, if you were to pass by my grave, would you prostrate yourself before it?**” He (Muadh) said, “**No.**” He (peace be upon him) said, “**Then do not do this.**” (Narrated by Abu Dawud [Book on marriage] no. 1828.)
