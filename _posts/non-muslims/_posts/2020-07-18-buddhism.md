Question:

Is there a revealed book for Buddhism?

Answer:

We do not know of any book which was revealed for them, rather the ruling on them is the same as that of idol worshipers. Therefore, if any of them embraces Judaism, Christianity, or Magianism, they fall under the ruling of the faith they embrace.
