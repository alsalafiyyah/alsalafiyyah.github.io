Question:

O Shaykh, it is said that when a baby is born, it will be written on his forehead that he is wretched or blessed. What is the ruling on those who die young before experiencing happiness or misery? 

Answer: 

This baby will be dealt with in this world as his family. If he is born to a Muslim family, then his body will be washed and the funeral prayer will be performed for him. Moreover, he will be with his family in the hereafter. But if he is born to a non-Muslim family, he will be considered one of them in this world. Therefore, his body will not be washed and the funeral prayer will not performed for him. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said about the children of the disbelievers who died: "**They are from them.**" In the hereafter, their affairs will be with Allah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said when he was asked about the children of the disbelievers: "**Allah knows what sort of deeds they would have done.**" [^1]
