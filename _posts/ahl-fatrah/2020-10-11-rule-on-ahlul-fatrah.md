Question:

Two people differed over the final destiny of Ahl-Al-Fatrah (people whom the message of Islam has not reached). While one holds the view that they will be saved from the Fire, the other thinks that they will not.  

Answer: 

Those who refused to embrace Islam after its message was conveyed to them, whether in the period before or during the time of the Prophet (peace be upon him) are treated as Kafirs (disbelievers). As for those whom the message of Islam has not reached, they will be held to account on the Day of Resurrection. This view is supported by authentic Hadiths narrated from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).
