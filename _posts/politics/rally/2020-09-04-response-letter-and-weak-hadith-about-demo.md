From Abdul-Aziz ibn Abdullah ibn Baz to the honorable son **Shaykh Abdul-Rahman ibn Abdul-Khaliq**, may Allah guide him to do what pleases Him and make His religion victorious through him. Amen!

As-salamu 'alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh (May Allah's Peace, Mercy, and Blessings be upon you!)

I received your honorable letter, dated 14/4/1415 A.H. It pleased me to know your acceptance of my recommendations. May Allah grant you more success and make you and us among the guided callers. He is the Most Generous.

I understood what you mentioned concerning the act of demonstration and knew, as you stated, that the Isnad of this narration is weak due to the unreliability of the narrator Is-haq ibn Abu Farwah. Yet, even if this narration is authentic, it is of the acts that took place at the very beginning of Islam before the Hijrah (Prophet's migration to Madinah) because the Shari'ah was not yet complete.

It is well-known that the basic rules of commands, prohibitions, and other aspects of religion rely on the proven principles of Shari'ah set after Hijrah. With regards to Jumu'ah (Friday), 'Eids Prayers, and other gatherings such as Salat-ul-Kusuf (Prayer at the time of a solar eclipse) and Salat-ul-Istisqa' (Prayer for rain) the Prophet (peace be upon him) advised us to offer, these acts are done out of displaying the rites of Islam and have nothing to do with demonstrations.

May Allah guide us and all Muslims to useful knowledge and act accordingly! May Allah rectify our hearts and deeds! May Allah protect us and all Muslims from the delusive trials and the insinuations of Satan for He is the One Who is capable to do so. 

As-salamu 'alaykum warahmatullah wabarakatuh.
