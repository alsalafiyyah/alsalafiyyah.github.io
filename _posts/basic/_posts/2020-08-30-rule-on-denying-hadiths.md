Question: 

What do you say about the people who deny the Hadiths of the Messenger (peace be upon him)?

Answer:

The Sunnah (acts, sayings or approvals of the Prophet) is the second source of the Shari`ah (Islamic law) after the Qur'an according to the Statement of Allah (Exalted be He): "**And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it).**" [al-Hashr: 7]

"**He who obeys the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), has indeed obeyed Allâh**" [al-Nisa: 80]

All Muslim scholars agree by Ijma' (consensus of scholars) on the obligation of acting upon the Sunnah. As for the person who denies acting upon the Sunnah, they are considered a Kafir (disbeliever) because they deny Allah and His Messenger and the Ijma' of Muslim scholars.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
