Question: 

Some people claim that some of the Hadiths in the books of Sunnah such as Al-Bukhari, Muslim and others contradict the Ever-Glorious Qur'an. These Hadiths include the Hadith on Al-Mahdi (a man named after the Prophet, who will appear as a sign of the Hour and rule according to Islamic law), the descent of 'Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him), the Hadith on Shafa'ah (intercession) and many others. What is your opinion concerning this issue?

Answer:

The Shar'i (Islamic legal) texts are from One Who is All-Wise, All-Knower, and there could never be any contradiction or conflict between them. The claim that some of the Hadiths reported by Al-Bukhari, Muslim and others which are authentically attributed to the Prophet (peace be upon him) contradict the Qur'an is false and utterly baseless. However, all that may appear to be contradictory on the surface is textually reconcilable. After considering and looking into the general Shar'i texts, all doubts and ambiguity are removed.

As for what you mentioned concerning Al-Mahdi, the descent of 'Isa (peace be upon him) near the end of time, and the Shafa'ah of our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), these Hadiths are authentic and should be believed in. They do not contradict the Qur'an.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
