Question: 

What is meant by "Related by the three" and "Related by the five"?

Answer:

The Three Compilers are Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhi, and Al-Nasa'i, whereas the Five Compliers refers to the three Imams mentioned previously along with Ibn Majah and Imam Ahmad.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
