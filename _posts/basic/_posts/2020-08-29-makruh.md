Question: 

What is the definition of al-Makruh?

Answer:

All Praise is due to Allah and peace be upon his Prophet, his family, and Companions. To proceed: 

Al-Makruh (what is disliked) is defined as an act that if abstained from, one is rewarded. However, if such an act is done no punishment is incurred.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
