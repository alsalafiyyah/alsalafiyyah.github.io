Question: 

On the evening of Friday, 4th of Safar 1403 A.H., I watched the TV show "The Natural World". The episode was about India. While giving a quick introduction to the episode, the announcer said that India is indeed called the land of religions where you can find Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, etc. Please explain the following: Are the beliefs the announcer mentioned considered to be real faiths? Were they revealed and sent down by Allah? 

Answer:

All that people believe in and whereby perform acts of worship is called a Din (religion), even if it is false. Examples of these beliefs include Buddhism, paganism, Judaism, Hinduism, Christianity and other false concepts. In Surah Al-Kafirun, Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**To you be your religion, and to me my religion (Islâmic Monotheism).**" [Al-Kafirun: 6]

Allah calls paganism a religion. However, the only true Din is Islam as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**Truly, the religion with Allâh is Islâm.**" [Aal Imran: 19]

Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And whoever seeks a religion other than Islâm, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.**" [Aal Imran: 85]

He (Exalted be He) also says: "**This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My Favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islâm as your religion.**"[Al-Ma'idah: 3]

Islam is to worship Allah Alone associating no partners with Him, obey His Commands, avoid His Prohibitions, abide by the limits He has set, and believe in what Allah and His Messenger informed us about regarding the past and the future. None of these false religions was revealed or accepted by Allah; rather, they are all innovated. Islam is the Din of all the messengers, however, their laws differed. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way.**" [Al-Ma'idah: 48]
