Question:

Do the Al-Asha'irah belong to Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community) or not? Can we judge them to be Muslims or disbelievers? [^1]

Answer:

[Al-Asha'irah](/asharis/) (a Muslim group that bases its creedal issues on logic) belongs to Ahl Al-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah) in most of their affairs, except their allegorically interpreting the Divine Attributes. Yet they are not disbelievers, rather among them are Imams, scholars and outstanding figures. 

Their fault is that they allegorically interpreted some of the Divine Attributes. They contradicted Ahl Al-Sunnah (those adhering to the Sunnah) on issues, including Ta'wil (allegorical interpretation) of most of the Attributes of Allah, which is wrong. 

The viewpoint adopted by Ahl Al-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community) is that we must accept the Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and Hadiths that speak of the Attributes of Allah as they are without Ta'wil (allegorical interpretation), Ta'til (denial of Allah's Attributes), Tahrif (distortion of the meaning), or Tamthil (likening Allah's Attributes to those of His creation). Rather, they are to be accepted as they are revealed, along with believing that they are true and real Attributes of Allah in a manner that befits Him (Glorified and Exalted be He) and that they differ from those of His Creatures. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**There is nothing like Him; and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.**" [al-Shura: 11]

"**And there is none co-equal or comparable unto Him.**" [al-Ikhlas: 4]
