Question: 

What is your opinion regarding the Qarmatians and Al-Batiniyyah? Are they considered Islamic sects or Kafir (disbelieving) ones? Please provide us with some information on them along with some other sects.

Answer: 

Both the Qarmatians and Al-Batiniyyah do not belong to Islam. Rather, they are Kafirs (disbelievers) and heretics. Scholars have written specific books to explain the falseness of the ideologies and beliefs of the sects in question. You may thus refer to these books and give special attention to the writings of the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him).
