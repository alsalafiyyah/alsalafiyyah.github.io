**Rapprochement between the Rafidah and the Sunnis is not possible, because their beliefs are different**. The belief of Ahl Al-Sunnah Wal-Jama’ah is Tawhid or the oneness of Allah and devoting worship sincerely to Allah alone, and that no one can be called upon alongside Him, no angel who is close to Him and no Prophet who was sent, and Allah is the only one who knows the unseen. It is part of the belief of Ahl Al-Sunnah to love the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all) and to be pleased with them, and to believe that they are the best of Allah's creation after the Prophets, and that the best of them are Abu Bakr, then ‘Umar, then ‘Uthmaan, then ‘Ali (may Allah be pleased with them all). 

The Rafidis (Shi'ah) are the opposite of that, so it is not possible to reconcile between them, just as it is not possible to reconcile between the Jews, Christians and idolaters and Ahl Al-Sunnah. Similarly it is not possible to achieve rapprochement between the Rafidis and Ahl Al-Sunnah (Sunnis), because of the difference in beliefs as we have explained.
