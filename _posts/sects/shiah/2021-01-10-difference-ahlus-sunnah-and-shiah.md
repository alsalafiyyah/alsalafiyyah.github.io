Question: 

We are in urgent need of information about the differences between the Ahl-ul-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah) and Shiites. We hope that you can explain something about their beliefs? 

Answer:  

Shiites have many sects. It is not easy to mention them in detail in a short time. In brief, some of them are Kafirs (disbelievers) who worship 'Ali and call upon him, and they worship Fatimah, Al-Husayn and others. Some of them claim that Jibril (peace be upon him) betrayed the trust and that Prophethood belonged to `Ali not to Muhammad. There are also others among them, such as **Al-Imamiyyah , i.e. Al-Rafidah Al-Ithna 'Ashriyyah** (a Shiitic group) who worship 'Ali and say that their Imams are better than the angels and Prophets. There are many groups among them; some are Kafirs (disbelievers) and some are not Kafirs (disbelievers). 

The moderate among them are those who believe that 'Ali was better than the three (Abu Bakr, ‘Umar and ‘Uthman). Those who say this are not Kafirs (disbeliever) but in error, because 'Ali was the fourth, and Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq, ‘Umar and 'Uthman were better than him. If a person prefers him over them then he is mistaken and is going against the consensus of the Companions, but he is not a Kafir (disbeliever). 

The Shiites are of different levels and types. Those wishing to know more about this may refer to the books of the scholars, such as Al-Khutut Al-'Aridah by Muhibb Al-Din Al-Khatib, Minhaj Al-Sunnah by the Shaykh of Islam Ibn Taymiyyah and other books that have been written on this topic, such as Al-Shi’ah wa’l-Sunnah by Ihsan Ilahy Zahir [also available in English translation] and many other books which explain their errors and evils - we ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. 

Among the most evil of them are the Twelver Imams and Al-Nusayriyyah who are also called Al-Rafidah because they rejected (rafadu) Zayd ibn ‘Ali when he refused to disavow the two Shaykhs Abu Bakr and 'Umar so they went against him and rejected him. Not everyone who claims to be a Muslim can be accepted as such. 

If one claims to be a Muslim, his claim should be examined. Who worships Allah alone and believes in His Messenger, and follows that which he brought, is a true Muslim. If a person claims to be a Muslim yet worships Al-Husayn, Fatimah, Al-Badawi, Al-'Aydarus, or anyone else, then he is not a Muslim. We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound. Similarly, anyone who reviles the faith, or does not pray, even if he says that he is a Muslim, is not a Muslim. 

The same applies to anyone who mocks at the faith or mocks at Prayer, Zakah, Fast, Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), who disbelieves in him, or says that he was ignorant or that he did not convey the message in full or convey the message clearly. All such people are Kafirs (disbelievers). We ask Allah to keep us safe and sound!
