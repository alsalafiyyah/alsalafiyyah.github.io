Question: 

What is the Shiite 'Aqidah (creed)? Please clarify as much as possible.

Answer:

Shiites have numerous sects, some are extremists and others are not. Hence, we recommend you read books written by scholars about their sects and the 'Aqidah (creed) of each. These books include Maqalat Al-Islamiyyin, by Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ash'ary; Minhaj Al-Sunnah, by Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah; Al-Farq bayn Al-Firaq, by 'Abdul-Qadir Al-Baghdady; Al-Milal wal Nihal, by Al-Shahristany; Al-Fisal fi Al-Milal wa Al-Nihal, by Ibn Hazm; and Mukhtasar Kitab Al-A'immah Al-Ithna 'Ashriyyah, and the like. Here you will get adequate information about their creeds.
