Praise be to Allah Alone. Peace and blessings be upon the last Prophet, his family, and Companions. 

The Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta' has received questions and requests for information about Al-Ahbash Group (the Habashis) and the founder of the group, 'Abdullah Al-Habashy which was founded in Lebanon. This group has many activities in some European countries, America, and Australia. Therefore, the Committee examined the books and articles published by this group, in which it explains its beliefs, thoughts, and call.

After having reviewed these materials, the Committee explains the following for Muslims: 

**First**, it is reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) from the Hadith of Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**The best people are those living in my generation, and then those who will follow them, and then those who will follow the latter.**" [^1]

The Hadith also has different wordings. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**I advise you to fear Allah, to listen and obey, even if a slave is appointed as your leader. Whoever among you lives after me (i.e. my death), will see differences arise. I urge you to adhere to my Sunnah and the practices of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs; clench your teeth on it (hold fast to it). Beware of newly invented things, for every Bid'ah (innovation) is an error.**” (Narrated by Ahmad, Abu Dawud, and Al-Tirmidhi who said, it is a good and authentic Hadith). [^2]

One of the most important characteristics by which those first generations were distinguished and by which they achieved a higher level of righteousness than other people, was the fact that they referred all their affairs to the Qur’an and the Sunnah. They gave precedence to the Qur’an and the Sunnah over all views, regardless of who supported them. They understood the texts of the noble Revelation (the Qur’an and the Sunnah) in accordance with the principles of Shari'ah and Arabic language. The Shari'ah was completely adopted in both general and specific issues. The ambiguous texts were explained by decisive texts. Hence, they upheld the Shari`ah, adhered to it, and held fast to it. They did not add anything to it or take anything away from it. How could they add or omit anything from the religion when they were adhering to divine texts which are free of mistakes and errors? 

**Second**, these generations were succeeded by others and Bid'ah (religious innovations) and invented matters emerged among them. Some of them held their own opinions. Those people forsook the divine texts and deliberately misinterpreted and distorted them to suit people’s desires and ideas. Thus, they disobeyed the Messenger, and followed other than the way of the believers. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And whoever contradicts and opposes the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) after the right path has been shown clearly to him, and follows other than the believers’ way, We shall keep him in the path he has chosen, and burn him in Hell - what an evil destination!**" [al-Nisa: 115]

It is a part of the favor of Allah (Exalted be He) towards this nation that He chooses scholars throughout time to refute every Bid`ah which distorts Islam, contaminates its purity, and competes with or tries to destroy the Sunnah. This is the fulfillment of Allah's Promise to protect His religion, as He says: "**Verily, We, it is We Who have sent down the Dhikr (i.e. the Qur’ân) and surely, We will guard it (from corruption).**" [al-Hijr: 9]

Moreover, according to the Hadith which was authentically reported in Sahih, Sunan and Masanid (Compilations of Hadith) and others, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**A group of people from my Ummah will continue to obey Allah's Command, and those who desert or oppose them shall not be able to do them any harm and they will be prevailing over the people.**" [^3] The Hadith has another wordings. 

**Third**, during the last quarter of the fourteenth century AH, a group emerged whose leader was 'Abdullah Al-Habashy. He moved from Abyssinia (Ethiopia) to the Levant (the region covering Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, and Palestine) taking his misguidance with him. He moved about in that region until he settled in Lebanon where he started to call people to his group. The number of his followers increased and started to spread his ideas which are a mixture of the ideas of Al-Jahmiyyah (a deviant Islamic sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah), Al-Mu'tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief), Al-Quburiyyah (Grave-worshippers) and [Sufis](/sufism/). He fanatically supported his ideas by engaging in debates and printing books and leaflets to propagate them. 

Anyone who reads what has been written and published by this group will clearly see that their beliefs go beyond the pale of Islam, meaning, Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). Among their false beliefs, for example are the following (for example and not exclusively): 

1. With regard to the issue of faith, they follow the school of thought of Al-Irja' [those who believe that sin does not matter as long as the person is a believer] which is condemned in Islam [^4].

It is known that the 'Aqidah (creed) of the Muslims, which was that followed by the Companions,the Tabi'un (Followers, the generation after the Companions of the Prophet) and those who follow their steps until the present day, is that Iman (faith) is the matter of words spoken by the tongue, belief is what is held in the heart and actions are what are done by the body. Belief must be accompanied by submission to the laws of Islam, otherwise the so-called faith is not valid. There are many reports from the pious Predecessors which confirm this belief, for example the words of Imam Al-Shafi'i (may Allah be merciful to him): “Among the consensus of the Companions, the Tabi`un, those who came after them and those whom we have met, is that they say: faith is words, actions and intentions; one of these three will not be complete without the other two."

2. They allow calling, seeking refuge with the dead and seeking help from them instead of Allah (Exalted be He). [^5]

This is major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) according to the texts of the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the Ijma` (consensus of scholars). This major shirk is the same as the religion of the earlier polytheists of Quraysh and others, as Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And they worship besides Allâh things that harm them not, nor profit them, and they say: “These are our intercessors with Allâh.”**" [Yunus: 18]

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only. Surely the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allâh only. And those who take Auliyâ’ (protectors, helpers, lords, gods) besides Him (say): "We worship them only that they may bring us near to Allâh." Verily Allâh will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Truly, Allâh guides not him who is a liar, and a disbeliever.**" [al-Zumar: 2-3]

He also says: "**Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): "Who rescues you from the darkness of the land and the sea (dangers like storms), (when) you call upon Him in humility and in secret (saying): If He (Allâh) only saves us from this (danger), we shall truly be grateful." Say (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): "Allâh rescues you from this and from all (other) distresses, and yet you worship others besides Allâh."**" [al-An'am: 63-64] and He also says: "**And the mosques are for Allâh (Alone): so invoke not anyone along with Allâh.**" [al-Jinn: 18]

Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Such is Allâh, your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmîr (the thin membrane over the date-stone). If you invoke (or call upon) them, they hear not your call; and if (in case) they were to hear, they could not grant it (your request) to you. And on the Day of Resurrection, they will disown your worshipping them. And none can inform you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) like Him Who is the All-Knower (of everything).**" [al-Fatir: 13-14]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Supplication (du'a) is itself the worship.**" [^6] This was narrated by the compilers of Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) with a sound chain of narration. There are many Ayahs and Hadiths in this context which indicate the same meaning. These indicate that the earlier polytheists knew that Allah (Exalted be He) was the Creator, the Provider, the One Who brings benefit or the One Who is Able to cause harm.

They only worshipped their gods so that they would intercede for them with Allah (Exalted be He) and bring them closer to Him and thus, they committed major shirk. Allah (Exalted be He) described them as disbelievers and polytheists and commanded His Prophet (peace be upon him) to fight them in order to devote worship to Allah alone as He says: And fight them until there is no more Fitnah (disbelief and polytheism, i.e. worshipping others besides Allâh) and the religion (worship) will all be for Allâh Alone [in the whole of the world]. Scholars have written many books on this topic in which they have clearly explained the true Islam with which Allah (Exalted be He) sent His Messengers and revealed His Books.

They also discussed the religion and beliefs of the people of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance), and their beliefs and their actions which went against the laws of Allah (Exalted be He). One of the best writers on this topic was Shaykh Al-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him), in his numerous books; such as his concise book "Qa`idah Jalilah fi Al-Tawassul wa Al-Wasilah."

3. In their view, the Qur’an is not the Word of Allah in the true sense. [^7]

It is known from the texts of the Qur’an, the Sunnah and the Ijma' that Allah (Exalted be He) speaks whenever He wills, in a manner that befits His Majesty (Praised be He) and the Qur’an; both its letters and meanings are from Allah (Exalted be He) in the true sense. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And if anyone of the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Word of Allâh (the Qur’ân)**" [al-Tawbah: 6]

Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**...and to Mûsâ (Moses) Allâh spoke directly.**" [al-Nisa: 164]

He also says: "**And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth and in justice.**" [al-An'am: 115]

He says: "**...inspite of the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis) used to hear the Word of Allâh [the Taurât (Torah)], then they used to change it knowingly after they understood it?**" [al-Baqarah: 75]

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**They want to change Allâh’s Words. Say: “You shall not follow us; thus Allâh has said beforehand.”**" [al-Fath: 15]

There are many well-known Ayahs transmitted from the Pious predecessors in the same context to confirm this belief, which is stated in the texts of the Qur’an and the Sunnah – to Allah is all praise and blessings. 

4. They believe it is obligatory to interpret the texts of the Qur’an and the Sunnah which speak of the attributes of Allah (may He be glorified and exalted). 

This is contrary to the Ijma'; from the Sahabah, Tabi'un and those who follow their path until the present day. Muslims see it is obligatory to believe in what has been stated in the texts about the Names and attributes of Allah (Exalted be He) without distorting the meanings, denying any of His attributes, discussing the hows and whys or likening any of Allah’s attributes to those of humans. Muslims believe that there is none like unto Allah (Exalted be He) and that He is the All-Hearing, All-Seeing. They do not deny any of His attributes which He has described for Himself. They do not change the words from their (right) places, belie or deny (or utter impious speech against) His Names or Ayahs. They do not discuss the nature of His attributes, or liken His attributes to those of His creation, because there is nothing that can be compared to Him, and He has no equal or rival. 

Imam Al-Shafi'i (may Allah be merciful to him) said: “**I believe in Allah and in what has come from Him as He meant. I believe in the Messenger of Allah and in what has come from him as the Messenger of Allah meant.**” 

Imam Ahmad (may Allah be merciful to him) said: “**We believe in those attributes and do not reject any of them. We know that the instructions which the Messenger of Allah brought are true. We do not interpret what the Prophet (peace be upon him) said about the attributes and do not describe Allah with more than He has described Himself.**” 

5. From their false beliefs, they deny that Allah is above His creation. [^8]

The belief of Muslims, as indicated by Ayahs of the Qur’an, the Hadiths of the Prophet, sound human nature and clear common sense is that Allah is above His creation, over His Throne, and that nothing at all of His creatures’ affairs is hidden from Him. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**...then He rose over (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).**" [al-A'raf: 54] In seven positions in His Book.

Allah says: "**To Him ascend (all) the goodly words, and the righteous deeds exalt them (i.e. the goodly words are not accepted by Allâh unless and until they are followed by good deeds)**" [Fatir: 10]

He also says: "**And He is the Most High, the Most Great.**" [Al-Baqarah: 255]

And said: "**Glorify the Name of your Lord, the Most High**" [al-A'la: 1], 

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And to Allâh prostrate all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth, of the moving (living) creatures and the angels, and they are not proud [i.e. they worship their Lord (Allâh) with humility]. They fear their Lord above them, and they do what they are commanded.**" [al-Nahl: 49-50]

Along other similar Ayahs. Many authentic Hadiths have been reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) on this topic; for example, the frequently transmitted story of Mi`raj (ascent to Heavens). The Prophet (peace be upon him) passed through the heavens one by one, until he reached his Lord, Who brought him near and enjoined fifty prayers upon him. He continued to go back and forth between Musa (Moses) and his Lord. He came down from the presence of his Lord to Musa who asked him, “How many (prayers) have been enjoined upon you?” When he told him, he said, “Go back to your Lord and ask Him to reduce them.” 

So he went back up to his Lord to ask Him to reduce them. It was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (Al-Bukhari and Muslim) that Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) narrated that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "**When Allah created the creation, He wrote in His Book, which is with Him above the Throne: ‘Verily, My Mercy prevails over My Anger.'**" [^9]

It was reported in the Two Sahih from Abu Sa'id Al-Khudry (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Do you not trust me even though I am the trustworthy man of the One in the Heavens...?" [^10]

It is related in Sahih Ibn Khuzaymah and Sunan Abu Dawud that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "The throne is above water; Allah is above the Throne; and He knows your states." [^11]

It is related in Sahih Muslim and elsewhere about the story of the slave girl and that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to her, "Where is Allah. She replied: In the heaven. He (peace be upon him) asked her: Who am I? She replied: You are the Messenger of Allah. Then he (peace be upon him) said to her master: Release her for she is a believer." [^12]

This is the pure belief which was adhered to by Muslims: Sahabah, Tabi`un and those who have followed them sincerely until the present day, praise be to Allah. Because of the great importance of this topic and because there are so much proofs - which exceed one thousand Ayahs and Hadith - scholars have singled them out with special compilations such as Al-Hafizh Abu ‘Abdullah Al-Dhahaby in "Al-‘Ulu lil ‘Aliy Al-Ghaffar", and Al-Hafizh Ibn Al-Qayyim in "Ijtima‘ Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah."

This is the pure belief which was adhered to by Muslims: Sahabah, Tabi'un and those who have followed them sincerely until the present day, praise be to Allah. Because of the great importance of this topic and because there are so much proofs - which exceed one thousand Ayahs and Hadith - scholars have singled them out with special compilations such as Al-Hafizh Abu ‘Abdullah Al-Dhahaby in "Al-‘Ulu lil ‘Aliy Al-Ghaffar", and Al-Hafizh Ibn Al-Qayyim in "Ijtima‘ Al-Juyush Al-Islamiyyah."

6. They speak ill about some of the Sahabah. [^13]

For example, they speak ill about Mu'awiyah (may Allah be pleased with him) in a way that resembles that of Al-Rafidah (a Shi'ah group denying the caliphates of Abu Bakr Al-Siddiq and `Umar ibn Al-Khattab and making accusations against them and many other Companions of the Prophet). It is the duty of Muslims not to discuss what happened among the Sahabah (may Allah be pleased with them all), safeguarding their tongue to mention the trial along with believing that all of them were good and virtuous because they accompanied the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). It was reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Do not abuse my Companions for if anyone of you spent gold equal to Uhud (in Allah's Cause) it would not be equal to a Mud or even a half Mud spent by one of them.**" (Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). [^14]

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And those who came after them say: "Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our hearts any hatred against those who have believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of kindness, Most Merciful.**" [al-Hashr: 10]

This is the sound belief concerning the Companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) which is the belief of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) throughout the centuries. Imam Abu Ja'far Al-Tahawy (may Allah be merciful to him) said, explaining the beliefs of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah: “**We love the Sahabah of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), but we do not exaggerate our love for any of them. We do not disown any of them. We hate those who hate them, and we do not say anything but good about them (Sahabah).**"

Love for them is true religion, faith and goodness; hatred for them is kufr, hypocrisy and transgression. Fourth, what we may note about this group is that they follow strange fatwas, which go against the Shari`ah texts. For example, they permit gambling with the unbelievers to take away their money; they permit stealing the unbelievers' crops and animals on the condition that it will not cause fitnah (trial); they permit dealing in Riba (usury) when dealing with the unbelievers; and they permit dealing in lotteries, which is unlawful. 

#### The following are some of the matters they adhere to which are obviously against the Shari'ah: 

- They permit looking at non-Mahram women (not a wife or an unmarriageable female relative) in a mirror or through a screen lustfully. They say that frequent looking at a non-Mahram woman is lawful. [^15]
- They say that it is permissible for men to look at any part of non-Mahram women. [^16]
- It is lawful if a woman goes out applying make-up and perfume without having the intention to seduce men. [^17]
- They permit free mixing of men and women [^18] along with other odd and outrageous fatwas which go against Shari`ah; considering some of major sins permissible. 

We ask Allah to keep us safe from the causes which provoke His wrath and bring about His punishment.

**Fifth**, from their outrageous means to turn people away from the scholars who have profound knowledge, and to prevent people from reading their books or referring to the reports transmitted from them: slandering, belittling and undermining them, and even calling them unbelievers such as Shaykh Al-Islam Abu Al-'Abbas Ahmad ibn 'Abdul-Halim ibn 'Abdul-Salam ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah be merciful to him). Abdullah Al-Habashy wrote a book specifically about this reforming Imam, in which he accused him of being misguided and misled. He attributed words to him that he did not say, and fabricated other lies against him. 

Allah (Exalted be He) will deal with him, and before Allah all disputing parties will ultimately meet. They also slander the reforming [Imam Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Abdul-Wahhab (may Allah be merciful to him)](/wahhabis/), and his call for reform which he undertook in the Arabian Peninsula, where he called people to follow Tawhid (belief in the oneness of Allah) and leave aside Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), to honor the texts of the Qur’an and the Sunnah and act according to them, to uphold the Sunnah and eradicate Bid'ah. By his efforts, Allah revived the teachings of Islam that had been forgotten, and through his efforts eradicated all kinds of Bid'ah. 

The consequences of his call spread - by the grace and favor of Allah - throughout the Islamic world and Allah (Exalted be He) guided many people. However, this misguided group directed their arrows against this call and against the caller; they have fabricated lies and propagated doubts and confusion, and have rejected this clear call to follow the Qur’an and Sunnah. They have done these actions to put people off the truth and to prevent them from following the straight path. We seek refuge with Allah (Exalted be He) against that. No doubt the hatred that this group has towards the great and blessed scholars of this nation is indicative of the hatred that they hold in their hearts towards everyone who calls people to worship Allah Alone and to adhere to Tawhid, which was the belief and the way of the people of the best generations. This group is far away from the essence of true Islam.

**Sixth**, based on what we have said above, and other things that we have not mentioned here, the Committee has decided the following: 

1. Jama'at-ul-Ahbash (the Habashis) is a misguided group which is against Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream). They must return to the truth which was followed by the Sahabah and Tabi'un in all aspects of religion; actions and belief. This is better and more lasting for them. 
2. It is not permissible to follow the fatwas of this group, because they adopt odd views which clearly contradict the Qur’an and the Sunnah, and they follow some far-fetched and corrupt interpretations of some Shari'ah texts. Because of all these reasons, ordinary Muslims should not trust their fatwas or believe them.
3. Their words should not be trusted regarding the Hadiths, whether they are related to the chain of narration or the meaning of Hadith. 
4. Muslims in all places must beware of this misguided group and warn others against them. They must beware of falling into their traps under any name or banner, and they should seek reward by advising their followers who have been deceived by them and explain the misguidance in their way of thinking and beliefs. 

Having stated this clearly to the people, the Committee is asking Allah (Exalted be He) by His Most Beautiful Names and Sublime Attributes to protect Muslims from all fitnahs (trials), both visible and invisible, to guide those Muslims who have gone astray, to reform their affairs, to turn the plots of the plotters against them, and to suffice Muslims against their evil. For Allah is Able to do all things, and He is most Generous in responding.

Peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, Companions and those who followed them with good.
