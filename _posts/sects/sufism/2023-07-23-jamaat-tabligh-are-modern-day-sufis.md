###### Question: 

Jama'at at-Tabligh, for example, say: **"We want to follow the methodology of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah."** However some of them fall into error and then say: **"How can you make rulings on us and warn against us?"**

###### Answer:

Even those who went out with the Jama'at at-Tabligh and studied with them wrote against them. Many people wrote about them and presented the errors that they have. So you should read what has been written about them so that the ruling in this regard may become clear to you. All praise is for Allah, Allah has sufficed us over having to follow this man and that man. So we have the path of Ahlus-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, which we adhere to. And we do not have over us a jama'ah (group) for conveying (tabligh) or not conveying. We are not in need of this. So what is there after the truth except falsehood? As for their realities, then many books have been written about them, so study them and you will come to know. Those who wrote about them are the same ones who went out with them, traveled with them and mingled with them. So they wrote against them based on knowledge and insight.
