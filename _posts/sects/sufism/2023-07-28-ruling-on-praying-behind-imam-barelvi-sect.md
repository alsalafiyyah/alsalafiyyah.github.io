Question: 

What is the ruling on praying behind an imam from the bareilawi sect, who believes that the Prophet ﷺ is alive and present and can see us? 

Answer: 

If they believe that, then they have gone against consensus of the Muslims, and if they seek his (ﷺ) help, then that is shirk, so it is not permissible to pray behind them.
