Question: 

The Salaf have mentioned the story-tellers (qassas) in the past and condemned them. What is their method and what should our stance be towards them? 

Answer: 

The Salaf, may Allah have mercy on them, warned against story-tellers since for the most part their intention was to affect people by telling them stories and tales that were not authentic. They did not rely on valid proofs nor did they have any concern for teaching people the laws of their Religion and matters of Creed. This was due to the fact that they lacked knowledge. 

Those who resemble them in our present time are the Jama'at Al-Tabligh with their well-known methodology and their mysticism and superstitions. They rely mostly on texts containing threats of punishment (for sins) in order to make people lose hope in Allah's mercy.
