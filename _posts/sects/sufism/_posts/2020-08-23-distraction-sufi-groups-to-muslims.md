Question: 

At present, specifically these days, Islam is being exposed to detraction by way of some Sufi groups, charlatans, sorcery, mythologies, and superstitions. What is the way the Muslim scholars should adopt to encounter false claims and misleading Bid'ahs (innovations in the religion)?

Answer:

Unfortunately, the enemies of Islam make use of those who ascribe themselves to Islam, such as superstitious people, Sufis, and others who follow Bid'ahs to propagate their falsehood and distract the Muslims by things that harm them and result in their disunity and disagreement, so as to fulfill their targets, seize the wealth of the countries, and disrupt the unity of the Muslims.

##### Resisting people of Bid'ahs and false beliefs:

The only means of safety against that danger is that qualified scholars, who are noted for their knowledge of Allah's Religion and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him), should direct the Muslims towards adherence to the truth of their religion, and the abandonment of every Bid'ah, and superstitions of the different and various Sufi ways that contradict Allah's Law and all newly-invented practices in religion that are propagated by many people. The Muslim scholars should also urge Muslims and assure them that there is no way for salvation and reunion except through holding fast to Allah's Glorious Book and to the Sunnah of His trustworthy Prophet (peace be upon him), and also through abandonment of whatever opposes them of prejudices and innovations.

##### The way is one and the same:

Indeed, Allah has perfected the religion and completed His Favor. Thus, there is no need to adhere to anything that opposes it, fanatically persist in it, or engage in disagreement because of it.

Rather, the way should be one, namely, adherence to the Glorious Qur'an and the Purified Sunnah by associating no partners in worship with Allah (Exalted be He), sincerely worshipping Him, renouncing the worship of other than Him, abandoning excessive veneration of graves and the dead and refraining from invoking them, beseeching them for help, and so on.

##### Bid'ahs and aberrations are fallacies:

They fall under associating partners with Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) in worship, although worship is an Exclusive Right of Allah Alone. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And they were commanded not, but that they should worship Allâh, and worship none but Him Alone (abstaining from ascribing partners to Him)**" [al-Bayyinah: 5]

He (Glorified be He) also says: "**So worship Allâh (Alone) by doing religious deeds sincerely for Allâh’s sake only. Surely the religion (i.e. the worship and the obedience) is for Allâh only.**" [al-Zumar: 2-3]

Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said in the Hadith reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhary and Muslim) on the authority of Mu'adh ibn Jabal (may Allah be pleased with him): "**The Right of Allah over His slaves is that they should worship Him and not associate anything with Him.**" [^1]

It is an obligation for Muslim scholars to spread the Allah's Religion and explain to the followers of Bid'ahs, Sufism, superstitions, and deviations the invalidity of the Bid'ahs that they adopt, illustrating the Honorable Sunnah and the clear-cut, tolerant way, supported with evidence from the Qur'an and the Sunnah, and to warn them against their mistakes in a kind manner using the clear proof, conclusive evidence, irrefutable argument and unequivocal style without violence or harshness. Rather, they should address them in lucid expressions and argue in a good way so that they could consider the matter carefully and discard superstitions, polytheistic actions, and Bid'ahs which they follow without guidance or insight. Indeed, truth is the long-sought objective of the believer, which, whenever he finds it, he should accept it. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And say: "Truth (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism or this Qur’ân or Jihâd against polytheists) has come and Bâtil (falsehood, i.e. Satan or polytheism) has vanished. Surely Bâtil is ever bound to vanish.**" [al-Isra': 81]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.**" [^2]

##### Bid'ahs must be renounced and fought against:

Every Bid'ah, aberration, and approach that opposes Allah's Law must be discarded. All people should pursue the way that was trodden by the Prophet (peace be upon him) throughout his life and then assumed by his Companions and the rightly-guided Caliphs and later followed by the virtuous Imams and righteous Salaf (predecessors), who treaded in their steps on the right way and straight path.

This is the way that must be adopted, followed, and preached and whatever disagrees with it including Bid'ahs brought about by the people must be abandoned and repudiated through explanation and clarification, so that none (of those rejecting the faith) would be punished except after clear evidence.

##### The methodology of the Islamic unity

His Excellency also spoke about the methodology of the Islamic unity, saying:

Islamic unity can only be achieved through the unanimous agreement of the Muslim rulers on the Religion of Allah, their holding fast to the Rope of Allah (i.e. the Qur'an), and their helping one another in righteousness and piety. Their objective should be maintaining the truth, guiding human beings, and taking Allah's Shari'ah (Law) as judge among people.

In this way, they would be united, as Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And hold fast, all of you together, to the Rope of Allâh (i.e. this Qur’ân), and be not divided among yourselves**" [Aal Imran: 103]

He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: "**Then We have put you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) on a (plain) way of (Our) commandment [like the one which We commanded Our Messengers before you (i.e. legal ways and laws of the Islâmic Monotheism)]. So follow you that (Islâmic Monotheism and its laws), and follow not the desires of those who know not. (Tafsir At-Tabarî). Verily, they can avail you nothing against Allâh (if He wants to punish you).**" [al-Jathiyyah: 18-19]

##### Holding fast to Allah's Shari'ah:
Thus, the only means to achieve true Islamic unity and real union is through the unanimous agreement of the leaders to resort to Allah's Religion, adhere to Allah's Shari'ah, help one another in righteousness and piety, and take Allah's Shari'ah as a judge, renouncing positive laws, manmade beliefs, and discarding imported theories that contradict Allah's Shari'ah. There should be no judge except Allah's Shari'ah which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), his Companions, and those who righteously followed him took as judge.

This is the only means to unify their word, bring them together, unite their lines, achieve victory over their enemy, retrieve their past glories, and honor that have been usurped by the enemy due to the existence of the causes of disunion, disruption, disagreement, combating and warring which have harmed and not benefited us.

##### The duty of scholars and the mass media:

His Excellency also spoke about the duty of scholars and religious specialists and mass media towards what those who ascribe themselves to religion and science in some Islamic countries and propagate Bid'ahs (innovations in the religion), superstitions, and aberrations. His Excellency said:

We are at the end of the time (worldly life). We are now in the fifteenth century of Hijrah, in which ignorance has spread and knowledge has diminished, as the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "**Time will pass rapidly, ignorance will prevail, and religious knowledge will decrease.**" [^3]

There are only very few insightful scholars in Muslim countries, while there are many bad scholars and charlatans who make the false claim of having knowledge while they are not scholars. They falsely ascribe themselves to knowledge but they are insignificant and valueless due to their lack of knowledge of the truth and their failure to support it. After all, the argument of dissenters, innovators in religion, and astray people is weak; if not frail.

It is the duty of scholars who support the truth and whom Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has guided through His Book and through the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him) and enlightened them on the truth until they learned the way of the Messenger (peace be upon him) and his Companions, and realized that victory undoubtedly comes through adherence to Allah's Religion and carrying it out in precise manner, that they call people to it, fulfill the Sunnah of the Messenger (peace be upon him), adhere to the true religion, and espouse what was brought by the Messenger (peace be upon him) to propagate the Islamic Da'wah (Call) and refine the creed of Bid'ahs, aberrations and deviations.

Those are the scholars upon whom hopes are hung and should call people to the truth. Such scholars are required to patiently undergo hardships, and preach Allah's Religion, and explain to the people the reality of Islam with which the Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent so that ignorance would be cleared, confusion dispelled, and truth would become manifest for those seeking it.

##### Return to the truth and the right path:

In consequence, the preachers of Bid'ahs and superstitions, such as the Sufis and others, would realize the falsity of their claims and thus, return to the right path and follow the truth, since many of them have been confused as regards the truth. If they perceive the truth, they would surely follow it and keep to its path.

Indeed, if the people endowed with knowledge, insight, and belief spread the truth, enlightened people on Allah's Command and called to His Shari'ah and explained the evidence of this, then Allah would guide whoever He wills to guide. By following this way, the scholars of Islam would have be doing good to people and conveying to them what they are required to convey, and would thus fulfill their duty. Afterwards, whoever deliberately goes astray, his affair is left to Allah. Allah has promised to fill Hellfire and Paradise, as He (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**Not upon you (Muhammad (peace be upon him)) is their guidance, but Allâh guides whom He wills**" [al-Baqarah: 272]

Indeed, religious scholars are required to convey, explain, and corroborate the truth with evidence, enlighten the people on it, and patiently persevere in this. After all, Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) guides whoever He wills to the truth.

##### Refinement of Islamic creed:
The mass media must propagate the pure Islamic creed that is clear of all stains of Bid'ahs, Shirk, and claims of sorcery, so that people would not go astray or be deceived by what the Sufis, preachers of Bid'ahs and superstitions say. Such is the duty of all mass media in order to serve the pure and clear creed and to propagate Islamic Da'wah. Allah is the One sought for help.
