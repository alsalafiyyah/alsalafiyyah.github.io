Question: 

At present, specifically these days, Islam is being exposed to detraction by way of some Sufi groups, charlatans, sorcery, mythologies, and superstitions. What is the way the Muslim scholars should adopt to encounter false claims and misleading Bid'ahs (innovations in the religion)?

Answer:

Unfortunately, the enemies of Islam make use of those who ascribe themselves to Islam, such as superstitious people, Sufis, and others who follow Bid`ahs to propagate their falsehood and distract the Muslims by things that harm them and result in their disunity and disagreement, so as to fulfill their targets, seize the wealth of the countries, and disrupt the unity of the Muslims.
