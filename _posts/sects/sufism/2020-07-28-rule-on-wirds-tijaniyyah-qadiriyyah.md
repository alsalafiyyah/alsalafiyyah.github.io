Question: 

What is the ruling on the Wird (sayings recited with consistency) of the Tijaniyyah, Qadiriyyah and other Sufi Tariqahs (orders)?

Answer:

Their Wirds are full of the Bid'ah (rejected innovations in religion) and innovated Dhikr (Remembrances of Allah) like other Sufi orders. It is better for Muslims to take Wird for themselves from the Qur'an and remember Allah with Dhikr reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him).
