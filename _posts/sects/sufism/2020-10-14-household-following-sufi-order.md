Question:

I am a monotheist but my household follow [**Al-Mirghaniyyah Tariqah (Sufi order)**](/sects/sufism/) which is known here in Sudan as [**Al-Khatmiyyah**](/sects/sufism/). Since I was guided to monotheism, I started calling my family to follow it but they refuse, as I am the youngest son. Is it permissible for me to leave them and start calling other people? If I do so, will I be among those mentioned in the Ayah (Qur'anic verse), "**O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?**" [Al-Saff: 2] The people I intend to call may say to me: "Go call your household first then call others." 

Answer:

Continue calling your family members and you can call others as well. You are not among those mentioned in the Ayah where Allah says: "**O you who believe! Why do you say that which you do not do?**" [Al-Saff: 2] As long as you are following the right path and calling your family and others to follow it. Allah is the Grantor of success and guidance and not you.
