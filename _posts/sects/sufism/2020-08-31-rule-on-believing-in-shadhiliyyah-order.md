Question: 

There is a Sufi order called “[Al-Shadhiliyyah](/sufism)”. Its members do not perform Salah (prayer), nor Sawm (fasting), nor pay Zakah (obligatory charity). They have a person whom they call “Sayyiduna” (our master) and regard him as their lord who will secure them in the Hereafter and forgive them everything which they have committed in their worldly life. These people gather on Mondays and Fridays mornings and on Thursdays and Sundays evenings. 

My father forces me to follow this order and gets angry when he sees me praying or fasting. He often says to me, “Sayyiduna (our master) will forgive us everything and will protect us from the torment of Hellfire and we will definitely be of the people of Paradise.” Of course this is a false belief, because he is a human just like them. What should I do? Please guide me! I believe that Allah is my Lord, Muhammad is Allah’s Prophet and Messenger, Islam is my religion and I observe its Five Pillars. 

If I obey my father I will disobey my Creator Who (Exalted be He) says in the Qur’an (regarding parents what means): "**...say not to them a word of disrespect, nor shout at them**" [al-Isra: 23] 

If I disobey my father, he becomes angry with me all the time and keeps fighting with me to make me follow this order. It should be noted that I cannot afford my own living expenses and I receive no support from my family except from my mother. Please guide me to what I should do to please my Lord and avoid the anger of my father who does not believe in Salah and Sawm, or more correctly the religion of Islam.

Answer:

If the situation is as you have mentioned and your father and the followers of this order do not perform Salah and believe that their so-called master or shaykh is their lord who guarantees them Paradise and forgives them all their sins, they are disbelievers. If your father orders you to follow them and forbids you to perform Salah or Sawm, you should not obey him, as the Prophet (peace be upon him) says: "**There should be no obedience to a creature in disobeying the Creator.**" [^1]

You should abide by Allah’s Orders and avoid His Prohibitions and treat your parents kindly in this world as Allah (Exalted be He) says (what means): "**And We have enjoined on man (to be dutiful and good) to his parents. His mother bore him in weakness and hardship upon weakness and hardship, and his weaning is in two years - give thanks to Me and to your parents. Unto Me is the final destination. But if they (both) strive against you to make you join in worship with Me others that of which you have no knowledge, then obey them not; but behave with them in the world kindly, and follow the path of him who turns to Me in repentance and in obedience. Then to Me will be your return, and I shall tell you what you used to do.**" [Luqman: 14-15]

You should follow the way of truthful believers who believe in what Allah has revealed and His Messenger (peace be upon him) has explained, and act upon the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of His Messenger (peace be upon him). Moreover, you should endure any harm you may suffer in the Cause of Allah and stick to the pathway of those who return to Allah as that is the best way and the best in outcome. You should also dissociate yourself from the people of this order lest they lead you astray. We hope that Allah will facilitate a means for you to earn your own living, as provision is in the Hand of Allah alone, not in the hand of your father or any other creature.
