Question:

As a pioneer of the Salafiyyah Call (Da'wah) and the current Islamic awakening, what do you advise us concerning dealing with Sufi shaykhs and their followers? I appreciate your guidance. May Allah reward you
 
Answer:

You should call the shaykhs of [**Sufism**](/sufism/) and others to Allah (Exalted be He) with wisdom, fair preaching, and argue with them in the best way as Allah has ordered His Prophet (peace be upon him). You should urge them to abide by the Sunnah and abandon any Bid'ah (innovation in religion). 

However, this should be done without rigidity and turning them away. If anyone refuses to adhere to the Sunnah they should be abandoned and people should be warned against him in a suitable way which does not have a negative affect on the call to Islam. If there was no possibility to forbid this evil totally, it should be reduced as much as possible.
