### Question: 
Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal stated in his book [As-Sunnah]: ****"The Qur'an is the Words of Allah, not created. So, whoever claims that the Qur'an is created is a Jahmite[^1], and a Kafir (disbeliever)."**** I would like to know from Your Eminence why those who claim that the Qur'an was created are considered Kafirs and judged as such by Imam Ahmad (may Allah be merciful to him)?

### Answer: 
The Qur'an is truly the Word of Allah. It was sent down to our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a revelation. Allah (Exalted be He) states: 

**"And if anyone of the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh) seeks your protection, then grant him protection so that he may hear the Word of Allâh (the Qur’ân)"** [at-Tawbah (9):6]

**"And this is a blessed Book (the Qur’ân) which We have sent down, so follow it and fear Allâh (i.e. do not disobey His Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be saved from the torment of Hell)."** [al-An’am (6):155]

**"And (it is) a Qur’ân which We have divided (into parts), in order that you might recite it to men at intervals. And We have revealed it by stages (in 23 years)."** [al-Isra’ (17):106]

There are many Ayahs in this context.

Accordingly, the Qur'an is the Word of Allah that is not created, and whoever says that it is created is a Kafir (disbeliever). The Speech of Allah is one of His Attributes and whoever claims that one of His Attributes is created is a Kafir, because the Attribute expresses the reality of the Self. Moreover, this false claim necessitates likening Allah's Attributes to those of His creation. Human beings did not speak until Allah created the faculty of speech in them. So whoever claims that the Words of Allah are created likens Allah to His creation - exalted is Allah above what they ascribe to Him. Allah spoke and will continue to speak as He wills. We do not say that He did not speak until He created speech, nor was void of knowledge until He created knowledge. Evidently, the matter is clear for seekers of truth when Allah guides them.

[^1]: A follower of Jahmiyyah, which is a deviant sect denying some Attributes of Allah, claiming they are ascribed to people and cannot be ascribed to Allah.
