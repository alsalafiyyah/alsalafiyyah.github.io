Question: 

Is it permissible to sit with people who indulge in Bid`ahs (innovations in religion) and participate in their lessons? 

Answer:

It is not permissible for you to sit with or consider them friends. You have to forbid them from doing such Bid`ahs and warn them against their dangers. May Allah protect us!
