Question: 

What is your opinion concerning performing Salah (Prayer) while wearing a watch that has the sign of the cross on it? Is this permissible, or not?

Answer:

It is not permissible to wear a watch that has a cross on it, be it in Salah or otherwise. This cross must be removed either by scraping it off or by covering it with some paint; however wearing a watch with the cross on it does not affect the validity of Salah, but it is the duty of the person wearing it to be quick in removing this cross because it is a symbol of the Christians and Muslims are not permitted to imitate them.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
