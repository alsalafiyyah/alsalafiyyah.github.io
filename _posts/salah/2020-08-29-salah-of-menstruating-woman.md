### Question: 

If a woman is purified from menstruation or postpartum bleeding before sunset, should she perform the Zhuhr (Noon) and the 'Asr (Afternoon) Prayers? If she becomes purified before dawn, should she offer the Maghrib (Sunset) and the `Isha' (Night) Prayers? We heard that some scholars say that we must do so.

### Answer:

If a woman becomes purified from menstruation or postpartum bleeding before the end of the due time of any Salah (Prayer), she should offer this Salah and the one which can be combined with it. For example, if a woman becomes purified before sunset, she should offer the Zhuhr and 'Asr Prayers; if a woman becomes purified after the appearance of the second dawn, she should offer the Maghrib and the 'Isha' Prayers; and if a woman becomes purified before sunrise, she should offer the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer.
