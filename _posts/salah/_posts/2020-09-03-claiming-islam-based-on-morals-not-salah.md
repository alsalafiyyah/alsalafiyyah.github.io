Question: 

Some people say that Islam is not just to perform Salah (Prayer), but it is to be of good manners. What is your opinion regarding that?

Answer:

Islam is made up of sayings, deeds, and conviction. Salah is one of the Rukns (pillars) of Islam and fostering good manners is an Islamic requirement. However, it is not permissible to confine Din (religion) to nobility of character and abandon the Rukns and the Wajib (obligatory) acts of Islam.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
