Question: 

What is the ruling on a person who forgets, or is asleep at the time of one of the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers, such as the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer, and they do not offer it until `Isha' (Night) Prayer? Does this person have to repeat the Fajr Prayer only, or must they repeat all the prayers they offered on that day, although they have offered them all? Please advise, may Allah be merciful to you.

Answer:

That person should offer Fajr Prayer only, and they do not have to repeat all the mentioned Salahs, as they offered them while in a state of forgetfulness that the Fajr Prayer is still due. Allah says: "**Our Lord! Punish us not if we forget or fall into error** [al-Baqarah: 286] It was authentically reported from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that he said, "**Allah said, 'I did.'**" [^1]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
