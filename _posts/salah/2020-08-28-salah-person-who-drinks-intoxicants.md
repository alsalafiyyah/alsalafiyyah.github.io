### Question: 

What is the ruling on a person who drinks Khamr (intoxicants) at night and offers Salah (Prayer) during the day? As Salah should prevent a person from committing immoral acts and Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), is their Salah valid or not?

### Answer:

If a person offers Salah with all its obligatory acts and fulfills its conditions, it is considered valid. They will be rewarded for it, and they will be sinful for drinking Khamr. They are considered among those who mix good deeds with evil ones. "**So whosoever does good equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it. And whosoever does evil equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall see it.**" [al-Zalzalah: 7-8]
