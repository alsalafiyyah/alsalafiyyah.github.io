Question:

What should I do to learn the Arabic Language and write it very well? Indeed, I did not have a good education and I want to enrich my knowledge in Arabic. I am the only person in my village who teaches children. I would like to have your advice on this. May Allah reward you with the best. 

Answer:

 You can learn the Arabic language by reading books on Arabic language. You should start with abridged books and practice books through applying the rules of language. You should practice speaking and writing language.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
