Question : 

What is the ruling of the Shari'ah (Islamic law) on someone who does not apply the rules of the recitation of the glorious Qur'an? As I do not know where I can learn these rules? 

Answer: 

You have to exert more effort to find a person who can teach you the rules of recitation as long as you wish to do so. But if you do not find a person who is a well-versed reciter in order to train you recite well, you can listen to the glorious Qur'an radio in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. You can imitate reciters whom you hear in this broadcast in order to improve your recitation. You are not required to know the theoretical rules as the difference between complete and incomplete assimilation, Izh-har (pronouncing every letter clearly without a nasal twang) and Ikhfa' (pronouncing the letter with a nasal twang), types of prolongation and the like. It will be sufficient for you to practice these rules which means that you will pronounce them in a proper way.
