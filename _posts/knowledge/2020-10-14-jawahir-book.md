Question : 

Attached to my letter is a booklet called Al-Jawahir fi 'Uqubat Ahl Al-Kaba'ir. I have read the entire booklet which quotes many Hadith and sayings that state the rewards and punishments such as the reward for Ruku' (bowing), Sujud (prostration), reciting Surah Al-Fatihah, and saying Subhana Rabiya Al-A'la i.e. "Glory be to Allah, the Most High" and Subhana Rabiya Al-'Azhim i.e. "Glory be to Allah, the All-Mighty" inside the Salah (Prayer). The foregoing example is in the middle of the eleventh page while there are so many other examples spread in various places of the booklet. My question is whether all that is mentioned in this booklet is considered authentic and reliable that you advise me to follow and use as a reference. May Allah guide us all to whatever He is pleased with. 

Answer: 

The book of **Al-Jawahir fi 'Uqubat Ahl Al-Kaba'ir by Shaykh Zayn Al-Din Al-Malibary** is not considered a reliable source with regard to rulings, distinguishing between major sins and minor ones, Du'a's (supplications), or Adhkar (invocations). 

We advise you to refer to the book of **Bulugh Al-Maram** by Ibn Hajar, its explanation **Subul Al-Salam** by Al-Sanâ€˜ani, and **Nayl Al-Awtar Sharh Muntaqa Al-Akhbar** by Al-Shawkani regarding Hadith Al-Ahkam (Hadith containing legal rulings). Moreover, you may refer to the book of **Al-Kalim Al-Tayyib** by Ibn Taymiyyah, and **Al-Adhkar** by Al-Nawawi regarding Du'a's and Adhkar while we advise you to refer to the book of **Al-Kaba'ir** by Al-Dhahabi, and **Al-Kaba'ir** by Ibn Hajar Al-Haytami to obtain reliable knowledge about major sins and their punishment.
