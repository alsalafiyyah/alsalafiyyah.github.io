Question: 

Can we believe in what we hear from the Christians from what is mentioned in their Injil (Gospel)?

Answer:

The Injil (Gospel) of today is not the same that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) sent down. Many distortions, lies, additions, omissions, and blasphemous statements are included. Allah states this fact in the Qur'an in His Statement, "**And verily, among them is a party who distort the Book with their tongues (as they read), so that you may think it is from the Book, but it is not from the Book, and they say: "This is from All창h," but it is not from All창h; and they speak a lie against All창h while they know it.**" [Aal Imran: 78]

Furthermore, He, the Exalted, states: "**Then woe to those who write the Book with their own hands and then say, "This is from All창h," to purchase with it a little price! Woe to them for what their hands have written and woe to them for that they earn thereby.**" [Al-Baqarah: 79] 

A Muslim should not read any of the Jewish or Christian books. The Prophet (peace be upon him) admonished 'Umar when he saw him with a paper from the Tawrah (Torah), then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**Are you confused about it (Islam), O Ibn Al-Khattab! By Him in Whose Hands my soul is, I have brought unto you a white, pure faith. Indeed, if Musa were alive, he would have no other recourse but to follow me.**" [^1] According to the narration of 'Abdullah ibn Thabit, then 'Umar said: "**I am pleased with Allah as Lord, Islam as a faith, and Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a Prophet.**"
