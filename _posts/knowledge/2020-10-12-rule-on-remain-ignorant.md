Question:

Are the ignorant about religious matters and the layman not brought to account for the things they do not know about? Is acquiring religious knowledge Wajib (obligatory) in their case? 

Answer: 

It is impermissible for a person to remain ignorant. They have to learn what they must know about their Din (religion) and gain religious knowledge from scholars. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know.**" [Al-Nahl: 43]

Therefore, if a person remains ignorant about their Din (Religion) while there are scholars they can ask and learn about Al-Haqq (the Truth) from, then they are sinners.
