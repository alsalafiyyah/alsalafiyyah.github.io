Question: 

I found a brass statue of a bird standing over a cross in the street. There is an antiques company, which sends its worker to collect all the ancient monuments left behind by the British and the Germans in World War I. Some friends told me that selling this bird-like statue is not permissible, because it reaches the Christians, who worship the cross under the bird. I was not convinced, because my friends did not give me evidence from the Qur'an or the Sunnah. I sold this antique for an amount of dirhams. Am I sinful for doing that? Answer me, may Allah reward you with the best.

Answer:

It is not permissible to pick up a Luqatah (a lost item found by someone else) unless one will announce it for a year in hope of finding its owner. If one does not find the owner, it is allowable to take it. But the case here is different, because the object found is a bird made of brass which is dishonored property. You should have destroyed it and it is unallowable to sell it, because it is an image that embodied a living animal. Thus, you are required to get rid of this money and give it to the poor.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
