Question: 

Someone asks: After finishing their Hajj, some pilgrims leave some of their belongings in Mina, such as thermoses, portable gas stoves. What is the ruling on taking them as their owners left them and went away? Do these objects take the ruling of Luqatah (a lost item found by someone else) in Al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah) or are they different? In addition, what about the shoes left in Al-Haram? Is it allowable to take some of them instead of the shoes that one has lost?

Answer:

It is permissible to take instruments, utensils and clothes if their owners left them willingly. Yet, if their owners forgot them or will return to collect them, it is not allowable to take any of them and the authority in charge of lost objects in Hajj should be reported.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
