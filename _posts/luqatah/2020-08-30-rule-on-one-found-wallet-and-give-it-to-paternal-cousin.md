Question: 

When I was almost fourteen years old, I found a wallet in the area where I live. It contained three thousand Riyals which I gave to my paternal cousin who lives with me in the same house. I turned to Allah (Exalted be He) in repentance of what I did. It must be noted that I knew the owner of the wallet, yet since I was not acquainted with him, I felt shy to give it to him. Moreover, the owner of the wallet lives in a remote area. What should I do? May Allah reward you with the best.

Answer:

You must return the aforesaid wallet to its rightful owner unless he gives you permission to use it freely. If you feel shy to give it to him personally, you may send it by any means possible without their knowing who the finder was.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
