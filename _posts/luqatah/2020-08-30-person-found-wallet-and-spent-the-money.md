Question: 

Nearly four years ago I found about four hundred Riyals in a wallet. Before I spent the money, I kept looking for the owner of the wallet, but I could not find him. So, I spent the money. What should I do to expiate for that sin? Thank you.

Answer:

Anyone who finds Luqatah (a lost item found by someone else) must advertise it in public places for one whole year, especially in the area where he found it. He should acquaint himself with the features that distinguish it from all similar objects. If the rightful owner is not found, he may give it in charity to the poor while intending to credit the reward to its rightful owner.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
