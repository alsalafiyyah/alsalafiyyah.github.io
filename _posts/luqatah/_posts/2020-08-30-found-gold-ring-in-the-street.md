Question: 

Five years ago, I found a gold ring in the street and gave it to my mother. Whenever she went somewhere where women would gather, she would ask them if anyone lost a ring but no one answered. The ring is still with us until now. Please, illustrate for me if I can sell it and give its price in charity or what should I do? I hope you will give me the appropriate advice.

Answer:

If the reality is as you have mentioned that your mother announced for five years about the ring in places where women always gather while its owner did not show up, it is permissible for you to use it. If its owner comes and identifies it one day, even after years, they should be given it or its price. However, it is better for you to give it or its price in charity on behalf of its owner.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
