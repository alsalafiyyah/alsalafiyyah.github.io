Question: 

I drove to Makkah Al-Mukarramah and parked my car in a parking lot. Upon returning, I found on the hood an electric machine worth about 150 riyals and nobody asked about it. I told some people about it and they asked me for it, am I sinful? Please, explain. May Allah guide you to all good. Amen.

Answer:

If the case is as you mentioned and you failed to find the real owner of the machine, it was obligatory on you not to take a Luqatah (a lost item found by someone else) in Al-Haram unless with the intention of making a public announcement of it. Anyway, you have taken it. Therefore, you have to get it back from the people who took it and to announce it. If you are unable to do so, you should deliver it to the High Court in Makkah and they will give it to the Committee for lost things in Al-Haram.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
