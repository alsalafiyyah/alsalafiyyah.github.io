Question:

Some people say that the lines on the right palm are in the shape of the Arabic number 18 and those on the left are in the shape of the number 81. The total of these two numbers is 99, which they say is the number of Allahâ€™s Most Beautiful Names. Is this true? 

Answer:

This is just a baseless supposition on the part of some people. We do not know of any religious scholar who has said this, therefore, it cannot be considered to be reliable.
