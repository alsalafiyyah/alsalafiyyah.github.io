Question:

What is the fate of the non-Muslim children on the Day of Resurrection? 

Answer: 

The preponderant view is that Allah will test them with some commands on the Day of Resurrection; whoever is obedient on that day will enter Jannah (Paradise) and whoever disobeys will enter Hell. This explains the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**Allah knows best what sort of deeds they would have done**" [^1] to answer a question regarding the fate of these children.
