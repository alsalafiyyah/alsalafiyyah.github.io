### Question:

Someone is known for their misbehavior and they publicly commit a major sin such as drinking alcohol. Thus, we are advised to keep away from that person and not to deal with him. Is this permissible? 

### Answer:

Warning against Fasiqs (people flagrantly violating Islamic law) and those who commit major sins is Wajib (obligatory). If a Muslim fears that his brothers will be affected by the misbehavior of Fasiqs, they have to expose the latter so that no one is deceived by them. Moreover, advising Fasiqs and those who commit major sins is also Wajib for it may be that Allah (Exalted be He) guides them. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: '**Religion is based on advising one another', and repeated it three times. Upon this we said: 'For whom?' He replied: 'For Allah, His Book, His Messenger and for the leaders and the general Muslims**'. (Related by Muslim from the Hadith of Tamim ibn Aws Al-Dary, may Allah be pleased with him). [^1]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
