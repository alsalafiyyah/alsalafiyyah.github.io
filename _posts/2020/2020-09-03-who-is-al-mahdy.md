### Question: 

Who is Al-Mahdy and what are the Signs of the Hour? 

### Answer:

Al-Mahdy is a man from Ahl-ul-Bayt (members of the Prophet's extended Muslim family), who will appear before the descent of 'Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) to call to Islam. Through Al-Mahdy, Allah will re-establish the evidences and guide many people. If you want to increase your knowledge on this topic, read what was written by Ibn Kathir (may Allah be pleased with him) in his book Al-Nihayah.
