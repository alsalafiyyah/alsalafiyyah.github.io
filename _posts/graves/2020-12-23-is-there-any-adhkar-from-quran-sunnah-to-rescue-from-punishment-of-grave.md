Question:

What is the evidence from the Qur'an and the Sunnah showing that certain things can protect people from the punishment in the grave? Are there any Dua's (supplications) said on a daily basis to protect us from the punishment in the grave? I read a Hadith that recommends reciting Surah Al-Mulk on a daily basis; how many times and when should it be recited? Thank you. 

Answer:

Fulfilling the obligations which Allah has ordained upon His servants, refraining from what He has prohibited, repentance and seeking forgiveness frequently, good acts of worship, and seeking refuge with Allah are all acts that may protect from the punishment in the grave. Allah says, "**O you who believe! Fear Allâh (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared. [Obey Him, be thankful to Him, and remember Him always], and die not except in a state of Islâm [as Muslims (with complete submission to Allâh)]**" [Aal Imran: 102].

Before ending Salah, the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to seek Allah's refuge from four things among which was the punishment in the grave. He ordered his Sahabah (Companions) to follow his example. There are no authentic Hadiths that recommend the recitation of Surah Al-Mulk as protection from punishment in the grave.
