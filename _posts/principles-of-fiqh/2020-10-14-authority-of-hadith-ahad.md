Question:

What about a person who denies the punishment in the grave, because the reports in this regard are Hadith-ul-Ahad (Hadiths which at some point in the chain have only a single narrator) which -they hold- can never be taken as basis for beliefs? They do not judge reports in terms of authenticity, acceptability, and weakness, but in terms of the numerous chains of transmission; whether it is a singular report or recurrently reported at each generation of narrators. Upon finding out that a certain report is singular, they reject it. How does one respond to this? 

Answer:

If a singular report is authentically reported from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), it is a credited proof according to the consensus of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (those adhering to the Sunnah and the Muslim community), whether on issues of worship or creed. Whoever denies the authority of Hadith-ul-Ahad after establishing the evidence against him is a disbeliever. For further explanation in this regard, refer to the book entitled Al-Sawa'iq, by Ibn Al-Qayyim or its abridged version by Al-Mawsily.
