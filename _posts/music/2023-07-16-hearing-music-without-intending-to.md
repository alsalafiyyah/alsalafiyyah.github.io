###### Question: 

What is the ruling on hearing songs on the telephone that you have no choice but to listen to when you booking flights with airline companies? Because usually the phone is answered with a recording that asks you to wait, then it makes you listen to songs or music; this also happens in the introduction to some religious or academic seminars, when we want to study in a particular seminar or academic program. 

###### Answer: 

Listening to songs is not permissible. As for hearing them without intending to – as happens in the street or on television – then we hope that there is nothing wrong with it.
