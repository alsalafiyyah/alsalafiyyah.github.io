##### Question: 

What is the ruling on listening to singing?

##### Answer: 

Listening to songs is haram, for Allah (Exalted be He) says, **“And of mankind is he who purchases idle talks (i.e. music, singing) to mislead (men) from the path of Allah…”** [Luqman :6], Lahwal Hadith (idle talks) mentioned here refers to singing, as interpreted by a number of the Sahabah such as Ibn Mas'ud (may Allah be pleased with him). 

It is related in sahih hadith by Al-Bukhari that the Messenger of Allah ﷺ said, **“At the end of time, there will be some people who will consider illegal sexual intercourse, the wearing of silk (for men), the drinking of Khamr (intoxicant) and the use of musical instruments as lawful. Allah will make the earth sink with them.”** The Prophet ﷺ mentioned musical instruments with committing zina, wearing silk for men and drinking alcohol, which are all prohibited. This denotes that using musical instruments is also prohibited.
