### Question:
Is it permissible for someone to frankly tell someone else about his defects?

### Answer:
It is permissible if it is done gently and with the intention of giving advice so that such a person might be prevented from making a mistake. On the other hand, it is impermissible if it is done out of the intention to defame or reproach.
