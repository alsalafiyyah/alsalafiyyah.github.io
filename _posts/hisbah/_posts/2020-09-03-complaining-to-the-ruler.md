Question:

Is it obligatory on me to complain to the Imam about someone who does not attend the congregational Salah (Prayer) or should I just advise him? 

Answer:

When someone refuses to attend the congregational Salah and does not respond to advice, **the Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice (CPVPV)** should be notified. The Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned burning the houses of those who did not attend the Salah. He did so to punish them and to deter others from copying them. Moreover, Allah (Exalted be He) in the following Ayah makes it obligatory upon people to enjoin good and forbid evil: "**The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden)**" (Surah Al-Tawbah, 10:71). 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
