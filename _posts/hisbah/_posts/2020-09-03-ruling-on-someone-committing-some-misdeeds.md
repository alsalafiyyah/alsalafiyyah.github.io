Question:

What is the ruling on someone who makes Isbal (Lowering and trailing one's garment below one's ankles), shaves their beard, watches pornographic movies, gossips and backbites, lengthens their nails, neglects offering prayer at the Masjid (mosque), mixes with women at theaters and parties, eats or drinks with their left hand without suffering any ailment in their right hand? 

Answer:

This person is regarded as a disobedient Muslim who should be advised and instructed so that perhaps Allah will show him true guidance. He should also be urged to turn to Allah in sincere repentance, perform many righteous deeds and seek Allah's forgiveness so that He may accept his repentance and forgive him.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
