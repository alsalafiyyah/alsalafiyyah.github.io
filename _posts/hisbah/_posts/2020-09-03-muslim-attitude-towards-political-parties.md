Question:

Some Muslims take part in political parties. These parties follow either Russia or America. There are many such parties, such as the Progressive party, the Socialist party, the Independence party, the Liberal party, the Nationalist party, the Youth party, the Democratic party, and others which are all similar. What is the attitude of Islam towards these parties, and towards Muslims who take part in them? Is their Islam sound? 

Answer:

Whoever has an understanding of Islam, strong faith, Islamic integrity, farsightedness and eloquence, and is thus able to exert some influence on the direction of the party so that it will take an Islamic direction, may get involved in these parties or with the one which is most likely to be more receptive towards the truth. This should be done in the hope that Allah (Exalted be He) will benefit others through him and guide whomsoever He wills to give up deviant political trends and follow the just politics of Shari`ah (Islamic law). In this way, the Ummah (nation) will be brought together on the Straight Path. However, he should not follow their deviant principles.
