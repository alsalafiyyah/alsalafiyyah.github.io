Question : 

Is it permissible for a person to touch the Mushaf or offer Salah (Prayer) if it happened that they looked at their 'Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public) while performing Wudu' (ablution)?

Answer: 

Yes, it is permissible. Looking at the ‘Awrah is not one of the annulments of Wudu’.
