Question : 

What should someone do if they wake up, make Wudu’ (ablution), offer Salah (Prayer), then go back to bed but find something causing doubts of having urinated on bed. What should be done, given that they prayed in their night wear, but it is just a doubt? 

Answer: 

The original state is Taharah (purity), and no consideration should be given to contingent doubt.
