Question 1: 

Does emission of wind from a woman’s front passage invalidate Wudu’?

Question 2:

A woman passes wind from her front passage when she bows and prostrates herself during Salah (prayer). This happens especially when she prostrates, and when she assumes the sitting position between the two Sajdahs (prostrations) to recite Tashahhud (a recitation in the sitting position in the second/last unit of Prayer) and all those surrounding her hear the sound. Does this invalidate the Salah offered by that woman? Sometimes, the wind she passes is so faint and cannot be heard, does this invalidate both Wudu’ and Salah? 

Answer: 

Passing wind from the front passage does not invalidate Wudu’.
