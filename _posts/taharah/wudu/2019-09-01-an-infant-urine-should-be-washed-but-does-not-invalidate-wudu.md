Question : 

I performed Wudu' (ablution) for Salah (prayer), then I held a baby that stained my clothes with urine. I washed the spot stained with urine and offered Salah without repeating Wudu'. Is my prayer valid? 

Answer: 

Your Salah is valid, because the urine of the baby that fell on your clothes does not invalidate Wuduâ€™, and all you have to do is to wash the part stained with it.
