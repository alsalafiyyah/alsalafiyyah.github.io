Question: 

At times, a white colored fluid is emitted from me, sometimes while I am praying. Should I interrupt Salah (prayer) and repeat my Wudu’ (ablution) or should I continue praying? Is this fluid considered Najis (ritually impure) and I have to take a ritual bath or do I have to purify myself only? Since it flows outside the body, should I change my clothes? Is this fluid harmful to me as it is discharged from me before and after menstruation? Sometimes it is discharged on continuous days and at anytime. This happens sometimes after I take a bath on Friday and on my way to the Masjid (mosque). Should I enter the Masjid to offer Salah or only listen to the Khutbah (sermon) without praying? Please advice me regarding this white fluid. 

Answer: 

All praise is due to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, his family and Companions.

This fluid is considered Najis and it comes under the same ruling as urine. Therefore, you should make Wudu’ after performing Istinja’ (cleansing the private parts with water after urination or defecation). You do not have to perform Ghusl (ritual bath), if it is discharged without having sexual thoughts or desires. You should wash the parts of your body and clothes on which the fluid besmeared. There is nothing wrong with entering the Masjid and hearing the Khutbah, but you are not allowed to join the congregational prayer until you perform Istinja’ and Wudu’ prescribed for prayer and wash the parts of your body and clothes soiled with it. We ask Allah to keep you and us safe and sound from every kind of harm.
