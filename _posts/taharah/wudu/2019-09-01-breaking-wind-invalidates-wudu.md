Question: 

Does breaking wind nullify Wudu’? Should a person perform Istinja’ (cleansing the private parts with water after urination or defecation) after it? Or is it sufficient to perform regular Wudu’ without washing the urethra and anus? 

Answer: 

All praise is due to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, his family and Companions.

Breaking wind is one of the annulments of Wudu’, according to the Ijma‘ (consensus) of scholars. Whoever does so should perform Wudu‘, when they want to offer Salah (prayer). After breaking wind, it is not obligatory to perform Istinja’, which is to wash the urethra and anus.
