Question: 

When does passing wind become an annulment of Wudu’ (ablution)? Is it by hearing a sound, detecting a smell, and feeling something, or only by hearing a sound or detecting a smell, excluding the feeling condition? Please explain this matter to me, may Allah grant you success, for I am confused. 

Answer: 

All praise is due to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, his family, and Companions.

What you have mentioned nullifies Wudu’ if a person becomes sure that something has come out of them either by hearing a sound, detecting a smell, or other things ascertaining the passing out of (minor) ritual impurity (wind, urine or stool), because when the Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about a man who gets the feeling of passing wind while in Salah (prayer), he said: “**He should not leave (prayer) until he hears a sound or detects a smell (of passing wind).**” (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^1]
