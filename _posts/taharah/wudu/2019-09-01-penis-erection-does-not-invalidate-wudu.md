Question : 

While a man performs Salah (Prayer), his penis becomes erect discharging nothing. Is his Wudu' (ablution) nullified? If so, should he interrupt or end his Salah, in case he has not yet completed it?

Answer: 

All praise is due to Allah Alone and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, his family and Companions. To continue, penis erection does not nullify Wudu’ unless there is seminal discharge. Having an erection is not one of the annulments of Wudu’. Therefore, his Salah is valid and should be completed.
