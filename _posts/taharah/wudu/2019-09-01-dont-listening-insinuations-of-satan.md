Question: 

Sometimes I feel while I am washing my feet or directly or shortly after performing Wudu’ something coming out through the urethra in the form of drops. Then I look and I may find traces of one or more drops and I may find nothing at all. This happens because I have no control over my urethra. Some doctors told me that this is something normal that afflicts young people and will end after I get married, while other doctors have different opinions. I cannot get rid of this and I am concerned in the first place with the ruling on Salah (prayer) and how this problem can be handled according to Shari‘ah. I frequently repeat Wudu’ but I am not pleased with this. I write to you hoping that you understand what I suffer from. What should I do if this happens after Wudu’? What is the ruling on my underwear? Please give me a decisive answer. 

Answer: 

All praise is due to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, his family, and Companions.

Purity is half of Iman (Faith). If after performing Taharh (ritual purification) a Muslim feels that something has come out and becomes certain of (minor) ritual impurity (passing wind, urine or stools), then he should repeat Wudu’ and wash the defiled part of his body and clothes. However, if he is not certain, he should not pay attention to this and his Salah (Prayer) will be valid based on what is reported in the two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of 'Abdullah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: "**The Prophet (peace be upon him) was asked about the man who imagines to have let out something during Salah (prayer). He (peace be upon him) said, “He should not leave (prayer) unless he hears a sound or smells an odor (of passing wind).”**" [^1]
