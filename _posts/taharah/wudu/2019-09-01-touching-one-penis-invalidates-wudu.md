Question : 

Scholars differ regarding whether Wudu' (ablution) is nullified by touching the penis. Those who say that it is not nullified support their opinion with the Hadith that says: “**It is just a part of you.**” What is the preponderant opinion? 

Answer: 

The preponderant scholarly opinion on this issue is the one adopted by the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars), which holds that Wudu’ is nullified by touching the penis, because the Hadith that says: “**It is just a part of you**” is Da‘if (weak); it is not strong enough to contradict the Sahih (authentic) Hadith that indicates that if someone touches his penis he must perform Wudu’. The basic ruling is that the imperative in these Hadith denotes obligation or duty. However, even if the abovementioned Hadith is assumed to be not Da‘if, it is abrogated by the Hadith that states: “**Whoever touches his penis, should perform Wudu’**” [^1]
