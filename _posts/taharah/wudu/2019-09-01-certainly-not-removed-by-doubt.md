Question : 

If I perform Wudu’ (ablution) and then offer Maghrib (Sunset) Prayer and after a while the prescribed time of ‘Isha’ (Night) Prayer becomes due and I want to offer ‘Isha’ with the same Wudu’ I did for Maghrib Prayer, but I am not sure whether or not I invalidated my Wudu’, what should I do? 

Answer: 

If you entertain doubts of Hadath (ritual impurity invalidating ablution) after having performed Taharah (ritual purification), cast doubts away and act based upon your state of Taharah, because certainty is not overruled by doubt.
