Question : 

Does looking at naked men and women or at one's own `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public) invalidate Wudu’ (ablution)? 

Answer: 

The mere looking at naked men and women does not invalidate Wudu', neither does the mere looking at one's own `Awrah, as there is no evidence supporting this.
