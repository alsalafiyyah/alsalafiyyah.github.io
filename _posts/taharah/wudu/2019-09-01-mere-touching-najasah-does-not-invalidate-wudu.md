Question : 

Sometimes, when I go on an outing with my family in the car, my wife’s clothes get so wetted with urine or the like of one of the young children so much so that she needs to change her clothes, and it coincides with the time due for Salah (Prayer), such as the Maghrib (Sunset) or ‘Asr (Afternoon) Prayers, yet it is not possible for her to change her clothes. Is it permissible for her to delay the Salah until she returns home and is Wudu’ invalidated if the body or clothes are soiled with Najasah (ritual impurity)? 

Answer: 

Wudu’ is not invalidated if a person’s clothes get soiled with Najasah due to contact with young children (when changing them), after their clothes get wet with urine or anything similar. It is obligatory that the soiled parts of the body or clothes should be washed, and then Salah can be offered in them. It is not permissible to delay the Salah until a later time.
