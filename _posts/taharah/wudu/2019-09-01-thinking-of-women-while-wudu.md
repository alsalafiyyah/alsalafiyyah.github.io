Question : 

Sometimes, while performing Wudu’ (ablution) many thoughts cross the mind which are irrelevant to Salah (Prayer) or Wudu’, such as men thinking about women while performing Wudu’. What is the religious ruling on this? Is Wudu’ nullified by this? 

Answer: 

Thinking about conjugal relations has no impact on the validity of Wudu’ as long as there is no emission of Maniy (spermatic fluid) or Madhy (thin white viscid fluid secreted when having sexual thoughts or desire). Mere thinking is not one of the annulments of Wudu’.
