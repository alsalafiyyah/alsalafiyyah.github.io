excerpt: "If you have performed Wudu’ (ablution), the basic rule is that you are Tahir (ritually pure), and this is based upon certitude. You should not, therefore, pay any attention to what contradicts this ruling by doubts and suspicions that something may have been emitted that would nullify your Wudu’"

Question: 

After finishing Wudu’ (ablution), I feel that something is coming out of me, like urine. So I go once again to perform Wudu’ and Istinja’ (cleansing the private parts with water after urination or defecation). I then go to perform Salah (prayer) in the Masjid (mosque) or at home. When I begin performing Salah, I feel the same thing again, so I doubt the validity of my Salah. Is it obligatory on me to perform this Salah again if I have this feeling, or should I perform Kaffarah (expiation) for it? Please advise us and may Allah reward you! 

Answer: 

All praise be to Allah Alone, and peace and blessings be upon His Messenger, and his family and Companions.

If you have performed Wudu’, the basic rule is that you are Tahir (ritually pure), and this is based upon certitude. You should not, therefore, pay any attention to what contradicts this ruling by doubts and suspicions that something may have been emitted that would nullify your Wudu’, because these doubts and suspicions are insinuations from Satan. However, if you are sure that something has been emitted that nullifies your Wudu’, then you have to perform Wudu’ again, regardless of whether this was before or during Salah.
