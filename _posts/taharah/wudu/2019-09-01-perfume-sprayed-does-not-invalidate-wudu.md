Question : 

I work in a pharmacy where perfumes are also sold. My hands touch these perfumes while dealing with the perfume tester bottles tried by the buyers who want to check the quality of the perfume they buy. Is my Wudu’ (ablution) invalidated by these perfumes? Please advise, may Allah reward you! 

Answer: 

Wudu’ is not invalidated when the hands or other parts get perfume on them.
