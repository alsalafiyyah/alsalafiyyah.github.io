Question : 

I often feel drops of some fluid being emitted from my penis after performing Wudu’ (ablution) or during Salah (Prayer), but I am not sure whether it is urine or something else. Does this invalidate my Wudu’ and Salah? When I get that feeling, should I stop my Salah and repeat it or not? 

Answer: 

If the reality is as you mentioned, you should not stop your Salah because of this, based on what the Prophet (peace be upon him) said when some people complained to him about the case of a man who thought he felt something while in Salah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “**He should not leave (prayer) unless he hears a sound or smells an odor.**” (Authenticity agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^1]. 

This is from Satan, who wants to spoil your Wudu’ and Salah, so you should not pay any attention to it, unless you are sure that something has come out of you, as indicated in the Hadith mentioned above. In this case, you have to repeat your Wudu’ and Salah, if you know that you let out something during Salah, whether you were the Imam (the one who leads congregational Prayer), praying alone, or Ma’mum (a person being led by an Imam in Prayer).
