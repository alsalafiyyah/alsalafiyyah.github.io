Question : 

Recently, many knowledge seekers insult the grand Shaykhs if the latter did not say what is agreeable to their whims or desires. What is your opinion? 

Answer:

May Allah grant us and them guidance! It is obligatory upon the scholars to beware of Ghibah (backbiting) and Namimah (tale-bearing) and respect Muslims. Ghibah and Namimah are among the worst traits. A Muslim should beware of them. Ghibah implies your talking about your brother in a manner which he does not like while Namimah implies spreading malicious words from one group to another or from one person to another as this raises enmity and hatred. It is obligatory upon all Muslims to beware of Ghibah and Namimah and to respect other Muslims, especially scholars. Muslims should warn others about disrespecting the scholars. As for those who practice manifest error or Bid'ah (innovation in Religion), there is no harm to mention their Bid'ah and explain its harmful effect.
