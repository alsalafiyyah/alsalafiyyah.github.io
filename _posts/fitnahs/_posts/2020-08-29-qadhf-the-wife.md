Question: 

Due to a quarrel between someone and his wife, he insulted her with obscene language as he said to her: "O adulteress." He claims that this word has come out of him unintentionally and asks about the consequences of this word?

Answer:

This word is one of the clear words of Qadhf (falsely accusing a chaste person of involvement in prohibited sexual relations). Claiming that it was said unintentionally has nothing to do with its effect. Since the word was said by the husband to his wife, it will have no effect if the wife forgives him and it will have no consequences on their marital life. However, if she does not forgive him, the issue should be referred to the court for settlement.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
