Question:

I found the attached poem and read it only to find that it includes verses entailing Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), such as "**If it were not for you, no human would have been created...**". The strange thing is that the poem is attributed to Imam Abu Hanifah Al-Nu'man. Is this true? May Allah reward you with the best. Is it permissible to distribute, read, and publish this poem? I hope Your Eminence will give a detailed answer about this poem. May Allah bless you! 
 
Answer:

This poem is a lie against Imam Abu Hanifah (may Allah be merciful to him). It is, thus, not permissible to attribute it to him. Also, the poem includes verses that exceed proper limits and excessively praise the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and this is definitely prohibited. 

Moreover, it includes Tawassul (supplicating to Allah in the name of a human being) and Du'a (supplication) to the Messenger (peace be upon him), which should not be done nor believed in, as this is Shirk or may lead to Shirk. Anyone who finds this poem must get rid of it, warn against it, and not propagate for it.
