Question: 

Is it permissible for a woman to accuse her husband of adultery when she sees any signs of it and what if she can not prove it, should she be whipped or not?

Answer:

The Hadd (ordained punishment for violating Allahâ€™s Law) of Qadhf (falsely accusing a chaste person of involvement in prohibited sexual relations) is applicable to males and females because of the general meaning of the Ayah (Qur'anic verse). Nothing can drop it for the wife or husband except forgiveness or Li`an (disproving a charge of adultery made by the husband against his wife).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
