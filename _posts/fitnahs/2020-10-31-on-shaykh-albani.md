Question: 

We have a knowledgeable Shaykh in our district, but he insults the other Shaykhs who contradict his opinions. This Shaykh mentions Shaykh Nasir Al-Din Al-Albani specifically and he warns people against him almost every night during the talks that he gives in Ramadan. He claims that this is the opinion of all virtuous scholars on Shaykh Al-Albany and that the latter is just a book dealer. Our respected Shaykh! Could you please tell us your opinion on Al-Albany so that we may convey it to this Shaykh as well as the large number of people who attend his lectures. 

Answer: 

In the Name of Allah, and all praise be to Allah Alone! 

Shaykh Nasir Al-Din Al-Albani is one of our special Thiqah (trustworthy) brothers who is renowned for his knowledge, virtue, and care for verifying the authenticity of the noble Hadith. Though Shaykh Al-Albani is not infallible and might err in declaring a Hadith as Sahih (authentic) or Da'if (weak); it is not permissible to insult, dispraise, or backbite him. Rather, we are to make Du'a (supplication) for him that Allah (Exalted be He) grants him more success and uprightness of intention and action. In addition, whoever detects a plain proven mistake made by the noble Shaykh is to advise and write to him informing him of it. This would be acting according to the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in which he said: "**Din (religion) is based on Nasiha (sincerity)...**" (Related by Muslim) [^1]. 

Moreover, the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**A Muslim is the brother of a fellow-Muslim. They have neither to oppress them nor to give them up to an enemy...**" [^2]

Moreover, Jarir ibn Abdullah Al-Bajaly (may Allah be pleased with him) said: "**I gave the pledge of allegiance to the Prophet (peace be upon him) for the following: to offer Salahs (Prayers) perfectly, to pay the Zakat (obligatory charity), and to be sincere to every Muslim.**" (The last two Hadith are agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^3]. 

On the other hand, believers - men and women - are protectors of one another specially people of knowledge for Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**The believers, men and women, are Auliyâ’ (helpers, supporters, friends, protectors) of one another; they enjoin (on the people) Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid (people) from Al-Munkar (i.e. polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all that Islâm has forbidden); they perform As-Salât (Iqâmat-as-Salât), and give the Zakât, and obey Allâh and His Messenger. Allâh will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allâh is All-Mighty, All-Wise.**" [Al-Tawbah: 71]

Thus, it is Wajib (obligatory) on all Muslims to be sincere to each other, to recommend one another to the truth, to alert the mistaken to their error, and to guide them to that which is right according to the Shar'i (Islamic legal) proofs. May Allah grant us all success!
