Question: 

What is the word you would like to direct to the Muslim Ummah (nation based on one creed) on celebrating the beginning of Ramadan? 

Answer: 

In the Name of Allah, all Praises be to Allah, and peace and blessings be upon the Messenger of Allah, his family, companions, and those who follow him. To proceed:

I advise my Muslim brothers everywhere on the occasion of the beginning of blessed Ramadan 1413 A.H. to fear Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), compete to do good, advise one another to do what is right, and be patient in this regard. Cooperate to do the good and be pious, be careful to avoid what Allah forbids everywhere, especially in this sacred Month as it is a month in which good deeds are multiplied in reward and sins are forgiven. Fast and observe Night Prayer believing in Allah and expecting His Reward as the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) stated: "**Whoever fasts the month of Ramadan out of sincere faith, and hoping to attain Allah's rewards, then all his past sins will be forgiven.**" [^1] 

"**When the month of Ramadan arrives, the gates of Paradise are opened and the gates of the (Hell) Fire are closed, and the devils are chained.**" [^2]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said: "**Fasting is a Junnah (i.e. shield or protection from the fire and sins), so when one of you is fasting, he should avoid intimate relations with his wife and quarreling. And if someone fights or quarrels with him, he should say, "I am fasting."**" [^3]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) also says: "Allah (the Exalted) states: "Every act of the son of Adam is for him; every good deed is multiplied from ten to seven hundred times except for fasting, for it is exclusively for Me and it is I will give reward for it. A fasting person leaves his desire, food and drink for My sake. Hence, a fasting person has two joyful occasions: One when he breaks his fast, and another when he meets His Lord. Indeed, the odor emitting from the mouth of a fasting person is more fragrant to Allah than the scent of musk."" [^4]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) congratulated his Companions on the arrival of Ramadan and said: "**Verily, the month of Ramadan has come to you all. It is a blessed month in which He sends His Mercy, obliterates sins, and accepts your supplication. In this blessed month, Allah looks at your competition in worship and praises you to the angels, so show your Lord the best deeds that you can offer. The unfortunate one is he who is deprived of Allah's Mercy in this blessed month." [^5]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: "Whoever does not give up false statements (i.e. telling lies) and acting accordingly, Allah is not in need of his leaving his food and drink." (Related by Al-Bukhari and his Sahih) [^6]

There are many Hadiths on the virtues of Ramadan, urging one to perform good deeds which are doubled during this sacred month.

I advise my Muslim brothers to keep on the right path during its days and nights and to compete in doing good deeds such as reciting the Qur'an as much as possible with contemplation, reciting Tasbih (saying: "Subhan Allah [Glory be to Allah]"), and Tahmid (saying: "Al-hamdu lillah [All praise is due to Allah]"), and Tahlil (saying: "La ilaha illa Allah"), and Takbir (saying: "Allahu Akbar [Allah is the Greatest]"), and imploring Allah to admit us into Paradise, keep us away from Hell and other good supplications.

I also advise my brothers to give a lot of Sadaqahs (voluntary charity) and support the poor and needy. You should take care of paying Zakah (obligatory charity) to those who deserve it, invite to Allah (Glorified be He), educate the ignorant, enjoin what is good, and forbid what is evil with wisdom and in good way. Avoid all bad deeds, repent, and be on the right path as Allah (Glorified be He) states: "And all of you beg Allâh to forgive you all, O believers, that you may be successful" [Al-nur: 31] 

"Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is (only) Allâh," and thereafter stand firm and straight on the Islâmic Faith of Monotheism, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve. Such shall be the dwellers of Paradise, abiding therein (forever) - a reward for what they used to do." [Al-Ahqaf: 13-14]

May Allah guide us all to what pleases him and keep us away from misleading trials and whisperings of devils. Allah is All-Generous, All-Bountiful.
