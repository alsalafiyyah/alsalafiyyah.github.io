### Question:
In which year, following the Hijrah (Prophetâ€™s migration to Madinah), was Hajj made obligatory? What is the most authentic report in this regard?

### Answer:
Scholars have differed concerning the year in which Hajj was made obligatory. It was said that it was in the fifth year after Hijrah. Others said that it was in the sixth year after Hijrah. It was also said that it was in the ninth or tenth year after Hijrah. The last two opinions which cite that Hajj was made obligatory in the ninth or tenth year after Hijrah are the most likely to be correct. And Allah knows best.
