Question:

Are major sins forgiven by virtue of Hajj Mabrur (Hajj sincerely done, not mixed with any sin, and is accepted by Allah)? When is trade permissible in Hajj?

Answer:

Firstly, it is authentically reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying, “**Anyone who performs Hajj and does not use obscene language nor commits a sin, will return (pure of sin) as on the day their mother gave birth to them.**” (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^1]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) also said, “**From (one) ‘Umrah to (the next) ‘Umrah is an expiation for whatever (sins committed) between them, and the reward of Hajj Mabrur is nothing else than Jannah (Paradise).**” (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^2]

Therefore, Hajj and other good deeds can be causes for sins to be expiated, if a Servant performs them in the manner prescribed by Islam. However, major sins must be repented of, because it is related in "Sahih Muslim" on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, “**The Five (Obligatory Daily) Prayers, and from (one) Jumu‘ah (Friday) Prayer to (the next) Jumu‘ah Prayer, and from Ramadan to Ramadan, are expiations for whatever (sins committed) between them, provided that major sins are avoided.**” [^3] 

Imam Ibn Al-Mundhir (may Allah be merciful to him) and a group of scholars hold the opinion that the Hajj Mabrur expiates all sins, because of the apparent meaning of the above-quoted two Hadiths.

Secondly, it is permissible to trade during the Hajj season, due to what Al-Tabary related in his Tafsir (explanation/exegesis of the meanings of the Qur’an), according to his Sanad (chain of narration), on the authority of Ibn ‘Abbas (may Allah be pleased with them both), regarding the Saying of Allah (which means): "**There is no sin on you if you seek the Bounty of your Lord (during pilgrimage by trading)." [al-Baqarah: 98] “Meaning there is no sin in buying and selling before and after entering the state of Ihram (ritual state for Hajj and ‘Umrah).**” [^4]
