###### Question: 

A Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) performed Hajj and a long time after their return from Hajj, Allah guided them to the sound ‘Aqidah (creed) and ‘Ibadah (worship). They repented to Allah and became a true monotheist. Will the Hajj they performed while they were a Mushrik suffice them or must they perform another Hajj after correcting their Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah)?

###### Answer:

If anyone performs Hajj while committing major Kufr (disbelief) and then returns to Islam, their Hajj will not count as the obligatory Hajj of Islam. However, if a Muslim apostatizes by committing an act that takes them out of Islam and then they make Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and return to Islam, their Hajj will count as the obligatory Hajj of Islam. This is because they were Muslims when they performed Hajj. The Qur’an shows that the deeds performed by a Murtad (apostate from Islam) before their apostasy are rendered worthless if they die as a Kafir (disbeliever), because Allah (Exalted be He) says: **"And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter, and they will be the dwellers of the Fire. They will abide therein forever."**
