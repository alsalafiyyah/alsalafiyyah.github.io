Question:

Some people claim that there is no obligation to go to the holy lands to perform Hajj. They also say that whoever goes there, comes back more coarse and merciless. Most of these people are financially and physically capable of performing Hajj, but they are reluctant. What is the ruling on whoever says this? Do they come under the same mentioned Ayah (Qur'anic verse) with regard to the fifth nullifier of Islam?

Answer:

Hajj is one of the pillars of Islam. Whoever denies or resents it after the proof has come to him is a Kafir (disbeliever) who should be asked to repent; if he repents, all is well and good, otherwise he should be killed. A person who is able to do it should hasten to perform the duty of Hajj, because Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah) to the House (Ka‘bah ) is a duty that mankind owes to Allâh, for those who are able to undertake the journey; and whoever disbelieves [i.e. denies Hajj (pilgrimage to Makkah), then he is a disbeliever of Allâh], then Allâh stands not in need of any of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists).**" [Aal Imran: 97]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
