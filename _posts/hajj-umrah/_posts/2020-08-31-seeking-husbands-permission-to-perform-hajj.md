Question:

I am a married woman for forty years. I've been asking my husband to perform Hajj and he agrees. However, every time he goes to perform Hajj or `Umrah he changes his mind and prevents me from accompanying him to take care of his sheep and cattle. Although he performed Hajj more than five times, he refuses my request to travel with my sons in law. Is it permissible to travel for Hajj with my son in law in spite of my husband's rejection?

Answer:

If your situation with your husband is as you described, you are obliged to travel with the said Mahrams (unmarriageable relatives), even if your husband does not give you the permission and provided that you have never performed the obligatory Hajj or `Umrah before. This refers to the fact that abandoning the obligatory Hajj, when the conditions of being able to do it are met, is Haram (forbidden). A Muslim should not obey a person in doing something that involves disobedience of Allah.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
