Question:

Is it preferable to perform Hajj every year for whoever wishes to do so and it is not difficult, or is it better to perform it once every two or three years?

Answer:

Allah has decreed Hajj upon every Muslim Mukallaf (person meeting the conditions to be held legally accountable for their actions) who is able to perform it once in a lifetime. Anything beyond this is voluntary and is an act of worship by which a person may draw closer to Allah. There is no report that specifies a particular number for voluntary Hajj, rather the number of times it is repeated depends on the persons' financial situation, health, and the circumstances of the people around them such as their relatives and the poor. This is in addition to other interests of the Ummah (community); how much of their time and money they devote to support the Ummah, their position within the Ummah, and whether there is more benefit for the Ummah in their staying or traveling for Hajj etc... Therefore, people should look at their own circumstances and what is best for them and the Ummah, and give precedence to that.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
