Question:

How important is Makkah to the Muslim world?

Answer:

Allah has made Makkah a place of resort for mankind and a place of safety and a holy sanctuary where pilgrims and scholars can gather to perform the rituals of Hajj and ‘Umrah (lesser pilgrimage) in an atmosphere of comfort and tranquility, hoping for Allah’s Reward and fearing His Punishment (Glorified be He). It is a place where Muslims get to know one another, and advise and consult one another over matters related to their religious and worldly life. It is also a place where the reward for performing Salah (Prayer) and righteous deeds is multiplied.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
