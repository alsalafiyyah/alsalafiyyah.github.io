Question:

We would like to inform you that many of our Sunni Muslim brothers who live on the Persian coast are desirous of performing the Islamic obligation of Hajj. The problem is that they cannot travel in the company of the Shiite Iranians for fear of disputes that might occur during the journey. In addition, the neighboring Arab governments do not allow them to travel via their airways. Is it permissible for them to send expenditures of the journey to other Muslim brothers of another country to perform Hajj on their behalf? Please clarify this matter as you issue your fatwa. May Allah reward you.

Answer:

They are obliged to perform Hajj if they are financially and physically capable, even if they must travel in the company of the Shiites. However, they should exercise extreme caution lest they be deceived by the false Shiite doctrines. They are also obliged, only if able, to advise them to follow and adopt the doctrine of Ahl-ul-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah). This is based on the Qur'anic Ayah (verse) in which Allah (Glorified be He) said: "**Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.**" [al-Nahl: 125]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
