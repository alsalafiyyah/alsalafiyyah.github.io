Question:

It is claimed that Allah (Exalted be He) ordered His Prophet Ibrahim (peace be upon him) to proclaim Hajj to mankind. Ibrahim did, and the people answered his call, even those who were not born yet. Those who did not answer him will not perform Hajj, even if they possess heaps of gold and silver. Is this true?

Answer:

Having finished building the Ka`bah, Allah ordered Ibrahim (peace be upon him) to proclaim to mankind the Hajj, as Allah states, "**And proclaim to mankind the Hajj (pilgrimage).**" [al-Hajj: 27] 

Ibn Kathir said in the Tafsir (interpretation) of this Ayah that Allah stated, "Proclaim to mankind the Hajj to the House which I commanded you to build." Ibrahim said, "O, Allah! How can I inform the people if I cannot reach them?" Allah stated, "You merely proclaim, and I will make them hear you." Ibrahim stood on his Station, it is said that he either stood on Al-Hijr , on Al-Safa , or on Abu Qubays, and said, "O, people! Allah has taken a House, so perform Hajj to it." It is said that the mountains knelt down so that his voice would reach all the corners of the earth, to the extent that those who were in their mothers' wombs heard it. Everything answered that call, even stones, mud, trees, and those whom Allah had predestined to perform Hajj said, "O, Allah! Labbayk (a devotional expression chanted at certain times during Hajj and 'Umrah)." This is what was reported from Ibn 'Abbas, Mujahid, 'Ikrimah, Sa'id ibn Jubayr and more people of the Salaf (righteous predecessors). Allah knows best. It was also narrated by Ibn Jarir and Ibn Abu Hatim in detail. This is the end of the words of Ibn Kathir (may Allah be merciful to him).

Allah knows the reality of this matter. As for the Adhan (call to Prayer), there is no doubt, as it is stated in the Qur'an.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
