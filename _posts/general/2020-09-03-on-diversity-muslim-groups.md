### Question: 
What is the ruling on having multiple Islamic groups? If I am convinced with the ideas of a certain group which is Al-Jama'ah Al-Islamiyyah, is it permissible to follow them despite my parents' opposition? They have sworn never to be pleased with me if I insist on my stance. What can I do? 

### Answer:
You have to follow the path of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) to which the Prophet (peace be upon him) guided us when sects first started to appear. He (peace be upon him) said, "**My nation will be split up into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in Hellfire except one." It was said, "Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?" He (peace be upon him) said, "Those who adhere to what I and my Companions adhere to.**" [^1] 

Thus, you have to stick to the main body of Muslims following this path.
