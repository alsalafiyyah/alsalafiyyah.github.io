Question: 

What is the ruling on having multiple Islamic groups? If I am convinced with the ideas of a certain group which is Al-Jama'ah Al-Islamiyyah, is it permissible to follow them despite my parents' opposition? They have sworn never to be pleased with me if I insist on my stance. What can I do? 

Answer:

You have to follow the path of Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) to which the Prophet (peace be upon him) guided us when sects first started to appear. He (peace be upon him) said, "**My nation will be split up into seventy-three sects, all of which will be in Hellfire except one." It was said, "Who are they, O Messenger of Allah?" He (peace be upon him) said, "Those who adhere to what I and my Companions adhere to.**" [^1] 

Thus, you have to stick to the main body of Muslims following this path.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
