Question: 

How can I learn Tajwid (reciting the Qur'an following the rules of recitation) and in which book can I find the rules of Tajwid? I heard your program "Rihab Al-Qur’an" and bought the book "Hidayat Al-Mustafid", but I could not understand it, because it was not clear. I used to study in an Islamic school in Djibouti. Could you suggest a solution? I am not educated and I come from a country occupied by Ethiopia. Could you send me a cassette recording of the Qur'an?

Answer:

You can achieve learning the proper recitation of the Qur’an by studying the rules of Tajwid from the book "Kitab Al-Hidayah" and other books, on condition that you get taught by a skilled teacher of Qur’anic recitation. You should also practice Tajwid often. You can get help in that respect by listening to the Qur’an programs that are broadcast by the Holy Qur’an Radio - Saudi Arabia.
