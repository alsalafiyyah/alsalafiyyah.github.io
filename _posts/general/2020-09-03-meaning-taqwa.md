### Question: 
I hear the call to observe Taqwa, but I cannot determine whether I have attained it, because it is a broad term. What is the way to attain Taqwa? 

### Answer:
Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has ordered us to observe Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah). Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**O you who believe! Fear All√¢h (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared.**" [Aal Imran: 102]

Observing Taqwa entails obeying all that Allah has ordered and abstaining from all that He has forbidden. Thus, a Muslim should abide by the actions and sayings which Muslims are ordered to follow and abstain from prohibited deeds and sayings.
