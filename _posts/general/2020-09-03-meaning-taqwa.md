Question: 

I hear the call to observe Taqwa, but I cannot determine whether I have attained it, because it is a broad term. What is the way to attain Taqwa? 

Answer:

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) has ordered us to observe Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah). Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**O you who believe! Fear All√¢h (by doing all that He has ordered and by abstaining from all that He has forbidden) as He should be feared.**" [Aal Imran: 102]

Observing Taqwa entails obeying all that Allah has ordered and abstaining from all that He has forbidden. Thus, a Muslim should abide by the actions and sayings which Muslims are ordered to follow and abstain from prohibited deeds and sayings.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
