Question: 

Can a person commit Kufr `Amali (disbelief in actions) which takes them out of Islam in normal cases? 

Answer:

The Kufr 'Amali which takes a person out of Islam includes performing Sujud (Prostration) and slaughtering animals for other than Allah. According to Ahl-ul-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream), the acts which indicate offering a sacrifice to the idols, Jinn or the planets, offering Salah or prostrating oneself before them, cursing the religion or the Messenger, or mocking at Allah or the Messenger fall into major Kufr 'Amali.
