Question:

What is the ruling on inability to properly pronounce the letter "ض" (Dad) from its place of articulation while reciting the Qur’an? People have differed over this. Some hold the view that the one who cannot pronounce it may replace it with the letter "ظ" (Dha’). Others say that it may be replaced with the letter "د" (Dal). Please clarify the issue for us. 

Answer:

A person who is incapable of pronouncing the letter "ض" (Dad) properly, from its place of articulation, should train their tongue as best as they can in order to pronounce it correctly. If they fail after exerting effort to pronounce it properly, they are excused and they may pronounce it in the way they can. They are not required to specifically replace it with the letter "ظ" (Dha’) or "د" (Dal), for Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope.**" [Al-Baqarah: 286] "**...and He has not laid upon you in religion any hardship**" [Al-Hajj: 78]
