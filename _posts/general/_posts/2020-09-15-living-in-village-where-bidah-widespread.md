Question:

The questioner explains his circumstances and those of the town where his mother is living. She keeps asking him to stay with her in the same town. 
 
Answer:

Given that the situation is as you have mentioned, if you can find a job in your town that sustains you and your family, and you have the ability of advising your country people without being affected by their Bid'ahs (innovations in religion), it will be better to obey your mother out of maintaining the ties of kinship and hoping that the people of your town might be guided through you. If you cannot find a suitable job in your town; you think that the people there will most probably reject your advice; or you fear that they might tempt you or your children with their Bid`ahs, there will be no sin on you if you stay in Alexandria or so to protect yourself and your children from Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). 

However, you should also maintain the ties of kinship with your mother and your relatives with money and visits as much as possible, according to Allah's Saying, "**Allâh burdens not a person beyond his scope.**" [Al-Baqarah: 286]

He (Glorified be He) also says, "**So keep your duty to Allâh and fear Him as much as you can**" [Al-Taghabun: 16]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**When I command you to do anything, do of it as much as you possibly can.**" [^1]

Leaving the places of Fitnah (temptation) and Bid`ahs related to Shirk to a place where your religion is protected, where you cooperate with Ahl-ul-Sunnah (those adhering to Sunnah), and where you are able to earn your living lawfully, is considered a Hijrah (a believer's migration to an Islamic land) for the sake of Allah.
