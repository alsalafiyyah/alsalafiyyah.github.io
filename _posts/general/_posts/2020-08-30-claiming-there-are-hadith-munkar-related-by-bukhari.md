Question: 

Some people deny some authentically reported Hadith and claim that there are Da'if (weak) and Munkar (rejected Hadith reported by a weak narrator whose narration conflicts with an authentic Hadith) Hadiths in "Sahih Al-Bukhari". For example, they deny the Hadith narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) regarding the ruling in case a fly falls into a drink. They further contest the reliability of the narrator on the pretext that he was a poor person begging people for food.

Answer:

First, it is not permissible for a Muslim to deny a Hadith judged to be Sahih (authentic) by Hadith scholars, for believing in them is a fundamental part of Iman (faith).

Second, "Sahih Al-Bukhari" is the most trustworthy Hadith compilation. This is with respect to Musnad (Hadith with a sound chain of narration) and Muttasil (Hadith with a continuous chain of narration to a Companion of the Prophet or Follower; the generation after the Prophetâ€™s Companions) Hadiths. As for Hadith Mu'allaq (Hadith missing link in the chain of narration, reported directly from the Prophet), they include both Sahih and Da'if.

Third, the Hadith narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah regarding the ruling in case a fly falls into a drink is Hadith Sahih whose authenticity is irrefutable in any aspect. Thus proved, it is obligatory for a believer to believe in it. Moreover, facts attest to its authenticity and thus it may not be denied.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
