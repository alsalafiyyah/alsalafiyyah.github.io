Question:

I am a Yemeni living in Saudi Arabia for more than ten years now. My parents are dead and I love reciting the Noble Qur’an. I often recite Qur’an in the Masjid (mosque), but there are some Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) which I cannot pronounce properly, for I have never been to schools. Is it permissible for me to recite the Noble Qur’an in this incorrect manner? Am I committing a sin this way or not? I hope you will clarify this issue. 

Answer:

You have to try to correct your recitation through learning how to recite the Qur’an at the hands of any accredited reciter. Also, you must frequently revise what you have mastered (of recitation) in the Masjid or other places. If you exert your effort in this regard, Allah will make reciting the Qur'an easy for you. It is authentically reported that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "**The one who is proficient in the Qur’an (i.e. Masterfully recites and perfectly memorizes it) will be with the noble, dutiful scribes (angels); and the one who recites the Qur’an and falters in it, and recites it with difficulty, will have a double reward.**" [^1]
