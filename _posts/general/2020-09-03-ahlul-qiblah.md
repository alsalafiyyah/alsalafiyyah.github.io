### Question: 
One of the principles of Ahlus-Sunnah (adherents to the Sunnah) is not to declare whether a person from Ahl-ul-Qiblah (literally: People who face Ka`bah-direction in Prayer) will enter Paradise or Hell. They should merely hope that the righteous will be rewarded and fear that the guilty be punished. Who are Ahl-ul-Qiblah? 

### Answer:
Ahl-ul-Qiblah are the Muslims.
