Question:

There is a tribe that promotes solidarity among its members. If a disaster befalls one of them - Allah forbid! - and the involved person becomes obligated to pay compensation, they all pay what is called Al-Ghurm, where the members of the tribe all bear the cost equally. However, if a member of this tribe dies in a car accident or anything similar, the Diyah (blood money) is distributed among their heirs. Are the other members of the tribe, other than the heirs, entitled to a share in inheritance or Diyah?

Answer:

After settling any debts and executing any Sharâ€˜i (Islamic) will, the wealth left by a deceased person and Diyah paid due to their death should only be distributed among their heirs. It should be divided among them as specified by Allah (Exalted be He) in His Book and by the Prophet (peace be upon him). No other member of the tribe is entitled to a share or should take anything of the share of one of them.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
