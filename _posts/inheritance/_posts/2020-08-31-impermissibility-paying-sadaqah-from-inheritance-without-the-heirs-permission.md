Question:

If a person dies, is it permissible to give, in Sadaqah (voluntary charity), to the poor from their money before dividing it among the inheritors and without taking their permission?

Answer:

This is not permissible, because it is a kind of disposing of the money of others without their permission.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
