Questions:

A woman was killed and her family accepted the Diyah (blood money). Can her husband inherit from this Diyah? We appreciate your guidance. May Allah guide you!

Answer:

The husband inherits from all that his wife left behind whether it is money or Diyah (blood money) or anything else. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
