Question:

There is a suspicious matter aroused by the enemies of Allah. They say that Islam wrongs women. When one dies and leaves behind a father, a mother, a wife and children, the wife receives half of the property and the father receives the rest even though he does not support the family. Why does the wife receive half of the property and why does she not receive the rest like the father?

Answer:

Certain things should be done before distributing the inheritance among the heirs. The debts of the deceased should be repaid before distributing the inheritance as well as executing his legitimate bequest if he made one. Then, the rest of inheritance should be distributed among the heirs. In this case, it will be divided into twenty-four shares. The wife receives one-eighth of the property, due to the existence of an heir, which will be three shares. The father receives one-sixth of the property which will be four shares. The mother also receives four shares which is one-sixth of the property. The rest of the inheritance, which is thirteen shares, will be divided among his children; the share of a male will be twice the share of a female. The wife will not be wronged, neither will the father, the mother nor the children. This division is according to Allah's wisdom and Justice.

There is also evidence for this in the Qur'an, Sunnah and the Ijma` (consensus of scholars). Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Allâh commands you as regards your children’s (inheritance): to the male, a portion equal to that of two females**" [al-Nisa :11] to His saying: "**And whosoever disobeys Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and transgresses His limits, He will cast him into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall have a disgraceful torment.**" [al-Nisa: 14]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
