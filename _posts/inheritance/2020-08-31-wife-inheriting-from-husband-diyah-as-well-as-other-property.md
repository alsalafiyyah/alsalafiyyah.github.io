Question:

A client of mine, Dr. Muhammad Tariq Mahmud, has received 100,000 Riyals as Diyah (blood money) from the driver who caused the accident that killed his son. The question now is: Does the widow of the deceased have a right to a share in this money?

Answer:

If his widow is a free Muslim woman, she inherits from his Diyah as well as from the rest of his property. Bear in mind that the distribution of the inheritance comes after repaying any debts the deceased may have incurred and the execution of his Shar‘y (Islamic) will if he made one.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
