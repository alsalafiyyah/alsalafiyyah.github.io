Question: 

Some common people, upon rising from their seat, would prop themselves up on their hands and invoke, “Ya Jaah Al-Naby” or “Ya Jaah Al-Rasoul” (In the name of the Prophet’s or the Messenger’s honor, merit, virtue, status, etc.) , or “In the name of pleasing parents”. Scholars say that whoever utters such words is a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in worship), because he is placing an intermediary between Allah and himself. They base their view on the Hadith of the Prophet (peace be upon him), saying, “If you ask, ask Allah; and if you seek help, seek it from Allah...”

Answer:

Calling, “In the name of the Prophet’s or the Messenger’s honor and status” or “In the name of pleasing parents” when standing up, is a form of supplicating the Prophet or one’s parents for assistance, which is an act of Shirk Akbar (major form of associating others in worship with Allah), we seek refuge in Allah.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
