Question:

Did the Barakah (blessings) of the Messenger (peace be upon him) end with his death? 
 
Answer:

Tabarruk (seeking blessings) from the Messenger (peace be upon him), his sweat, and the water he used for Wudu' (ablution) was permissible during his lifetime, for it was possible to obtain these things and seek Tabarruk from them. However, this is not permissible after his death, as these things ended with his death and can no longer be obtained.
