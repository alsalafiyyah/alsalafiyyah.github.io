### Question: 
Can a person make Tawassul (beseech Allah in the name of or by) through the Qur’an and Islamic holy days, such as saying, “O Allah! I ask you by the virtue of the Day of 'Arafah” and so on?

### Answer:
It is permissible to make Tawassul by the Qur’an, because it is the Speech of Allah in word and meaning, and His Speech is one of His Attributes, so it is considered as beseeching Allah by one of His Attributes, which does not contradict Tawhid (monotheism) or is a means to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). As for Tawassul by a particular day, it is impermissible, because it is Tawassul by a creature, and accordingly is a means to Shirk. This is also violative of the guidelines of Shari‘ah, such as the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him): “**Whoever does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam), will have it rejected.**” Narrated by Muslim in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith [^1].

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
