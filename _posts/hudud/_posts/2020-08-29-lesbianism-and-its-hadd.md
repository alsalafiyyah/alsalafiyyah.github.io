Question: 

What is the meaning of lesbianism? Is there any punishment for it?

Answer:

Lesbianism stands for homosexuality between females. It is forbidden and those who commit it have to be punished with Ta'zir (discretionary punishment) and not Hadd (ordained punishment for violating Allah's Law).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
