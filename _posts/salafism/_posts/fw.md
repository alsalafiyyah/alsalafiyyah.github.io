Question: 

In Sudan, an Islamic Organization among the various movements of Sufism and Salafism has been established. This organization involves itself in political action and broad confrontations with Communist and Westernization groups in general.
What is your opinion on these activities undertaken by similar organizations? 

Answer:

There is no doubt that cooperation between Muslims in confronting destructive ideologies, misguiding missions and evangelical, communist and vicious activities is a key duty and a great form of Jihad in the cause of Allah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment. Allah (Glorified be He) also says: Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.
