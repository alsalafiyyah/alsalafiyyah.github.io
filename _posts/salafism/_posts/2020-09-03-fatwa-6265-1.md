Question: 

What are the fundamentals and principles of the Salafi (those who following the way of the righteous predecessors) call (Da'wah)? 

Answer:

The Salafi Da'wah is a call to follow the footsteps of the Messenger (peace be upon him), his Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them), and those who follow them in righteousness, with wisdom, fair preaching, and arguing in the best way along with struggling with one's soul to act accordingly toward all that the person is calling for.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
