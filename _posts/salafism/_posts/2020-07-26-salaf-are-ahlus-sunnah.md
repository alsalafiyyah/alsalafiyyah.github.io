Question: 

Some people do not define themselves as Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jama`ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream) claiming that all people do so. They say that it is more accurate for Muslims to relate themselves to Salaf (righteous predecessors). Is this correct?

Answer:

Salaf are Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah. Accordingly, it is permissible for a person to relate themselves to Salaf. Doing so is correct, as it is equivalent to declaring oneself as one of Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah, a believer in Allah and the Last Day, and a follower of Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet). When one relates themselves to the Salaf they ascribe themselves to the people of truth, not falsehood. Thus, they must strive to be truthful.
