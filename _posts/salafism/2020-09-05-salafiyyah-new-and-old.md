### Question:
Is there a 'Salafiyyah Qadeemah (old)' and 'Salafiyyah Jadeedah (new)', or is there just one Salafiyyah?

### Answer:
There is only one Salafiyyah, the one who claims that there is an old and new Salafiyyah has lied. If we contemplate over the 'aqeedah of the Salaf from the time of the sahaabah to our time today, we find it to be one 'aqeedah, never contradicting each other. Even if they differed in the subsidiary legislations which are not from the fundamentals and beliefs, then surely they disagree in this (subsidiary legislations). Not one of them belittles the other. This was the way of the sahaabaah, may Allaah the most high be pleased with them all. As for the beliefs, then their manhaj (methodology) in this regard is one from the time of the Companions until now.
