Question: 

There are many points of disagreement among the Salafiyyah (those following the way of the righteous predecessors) and between them and other Islamic groups in the Manhaj (methodology) and bases upon which they build their Da`wah (calling to Islam). Is the disagreement among Salafiyyah groups less evil than that between them and other Islamic groups, since the former is in application and dealings while the latter is in Manhaj and scientific bases?

Answer:

It is obligatory to avoid disagreement between Muslims in general and scholars in particular. If any conflict should occur, it will be necessary to refer it to the Qur'an and Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) to know the truth and adopt it, and discard whatever contradicts it. Allah (Exalted be He) says, "**And in whatsoever you differ, the decision thereof is with Allâh (He is the ruling Judge).**" [al-Shura: 10]

Allah also says, "**(And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.**" [al-Nisa: 59]

This ruling covers all differences between Muslims whether regarding `Aqidah (creed), sayings or deeds. Difference should be referred to the Qur'an and Sunnah for Muslims to follow the correct ruling and abandon the incorrect ones, while totally accepting and submitting to the judgment of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
