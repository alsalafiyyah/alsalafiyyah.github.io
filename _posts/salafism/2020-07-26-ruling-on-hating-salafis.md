### Question: 
There are some partisans who call for applying the Islamic Shari'ah though they are completely opposite to that. They have diluted Islam and consider those who do not embrace their thoughts, even if they are opposite to the Qur'an and Sunnah, as enemies of Islam. In addition, their hatred to Ahl-us-Sunnah wal-Jama'ah (adherents to the Sunnah and the Muslim mainstream), is deeply rooted, especially Salafis (those who following the way of the righteous predecessors). They insult and abuse them to the extent that they blaspheme their leadership figures labeling them as backward and intolerant. Is it permissible to support them or ask their advice? Or should they be disciplined by abandoning them?

### Answer:
Any Da'i (caller to Islam) who does not adhere to the Manhaj (methodology) of the Messengers and that of their followers concerning Da'wah (calling to Islam), and follows the Manhaj of misleading sects which introduce bid'ahs (deviant innovations in religion) such as Al-Khawarij (separatist group that believes committing a major sin amounts to disbelief) and Al-Mu'tazilah (a deviant Islamic sect claiming that those who commit major sins are in a state between belief and disbelief) - it is impermissible for you to either be in his company or associate with him. You should rather condemn him and warn people against him.
