Question: 

In Sudan, an Islamic Organization among the various movements of [Sufism](/sufism/ "Sufism") and Salafism has been established. This organization involves itself in political action and broad confrontations with Communist and Westernization groups in general. What is your opinion on these activities undertaken by similar organizations? 

Answer:

There is no doubt that cooperation between Muslims in confronting destructive ideologies, misguiding missions and evangelical, communist and vicious activities is a key duty and a great form of Jihad in the cause of Allah. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: "**Help you one another in Al-Birr and At-Taqwâ (virtue, righteousness and piety); but do not help one another in sin and transgression. And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is Severe in punishment.**" [al-Ma'idah: 2] 

Allah (Glorified be He) also says: "**Invite (mankind, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه و سلم) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better.**" [al-Nahl: 125]]

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: "**And who is better in speech than he who [says: "My Lord is Allâh (believes in His Oneness)," and then stands firm (acts upon His Order), and] invites (men) to Allâh’s (Islâmic Monotheism), and does righteous deeds, and says: "I am one of the Muslims."**" [Fussilat: 33]

In the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim), it was narrated on the authority of Sahl ibn Sa'd (may Allah be pleased with him) that when the Prophet (peace be upon him) sent 'Ali ibn Abu Talib (may Allah be pleased with him) to the Jews in Khaybar, he commanded him to call them to Islam and tell them of their duties towards Allah. The Prophet (peace be upon him) told him: "**By Allah, if Allah guides aright even one man through you that is better for you than to possess the most valuable of the camels.**" [^1]

In Sahih Muslim, it was related on the authority of Abu Mas'ud Al-Ansary that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**One who guides to something good has a reward similar to that of its doer.**" [^2]

Also in Sahih Muslim, it was narrated on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: "**If anyone calls others to follow right guidance, his reward will be equivalent to those who follow him (in righteousness) without their reward being diminished in any respect, and if anyone invites others to follow error, the sin will be equivalent to that of the people who follow him (in sinfulness) without their sins being diminished in any respect**". [^3]

It is related by Imam Ahmad and Al-Nasa'i and authenticated by Al-Hakim on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: "**Use your property, your persons and your tongues in striving against the Mushrikun.**" [^4]

There are many Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and Hadiths to this effect. We implore Allah to guide this organization to what supports the truth and causes it to prevail, abolishes falsehood and its advocates.

I advise the organization to rid itself of all that contradicts Allah's Purified Shari'ah (Islamic Law) from among its members, advise and enjoin one another to constantly observe Islam and remain steadfast on the Shari'ah of Allah. Also, they must refer the matters about which they dispute to Allah and the Messenger (peace be upon him), as Allah (Glorified be He) states: "**O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority. (And) if you differ in anything amongst yourselves, refer it to Allâh and His Messenger (صلى الله عليه وسلم), if you believe in Allâh and in the Last Day. That is better and more suitable for final determination.**" [al-Nisa: 59]

He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also states: "**By Al-‘Asr (the time). Verily, man is in loss, Except those who believe (in Islâmic Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds, and recommend one another to the truth [i.e. order one another to perform all kinds of good deeds (Al-Ma‘ruf) which Allâh has ordained, and abstain from all kinds of sins and evil deeds (Al-Munkar which Allâh has forbidden], and recommend one another to patience (for the sufferings, harms, and injuries which one may encounter in Allâh’s Cause during preaching His religion of Islâmic Monotheism or Jihâd).**" [al-'Asr: 1-3]
 
In this great Surah, Allah (Glorified be He) explains that the means of prosperity, happiness, and safety from loss are the four matters mentioned in this Surah, namely, true faith in Allah and His Messenger, performing righteous deeds, and enjoining one another to truth and enjoining one another to patience.

We ask Allah to guide members of the organization to adopt these morals and be firm on them in order to achieve open victory, great reward, and good end.
