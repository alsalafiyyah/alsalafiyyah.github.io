### Question:
Some of the people claim that Salafiyyah is considered a Jamaa’ah from amongst the jamaa’aat that are working within the arena, and that its ruling is the same as the ruling upon the rest of the jamaa’aat. So what is your assessment of this claim?

### Answer:
The Jamaa’ah of as-Salafiyyah is the Jamaa’ah which is upon the truth, and it is the one that it is obligatory to belong to, act in accordance with and to ascribe to. And everything else from amongst the jamaa’aat, then it is obligatory that they not be considered jamaa’aat of da’wah, because they are in opposition. How can we follow a sect that opposes the Jamaa’ah of Ahlus-Sunnah and the guidance of the Salafus-Saalih?!

Whatever opposes the Jamaa’ah of Salafiyyah, then it opposes the manhaj of the Messenger ﷺ. It is in opposition to whatever the Messenger ﷺ and his Companions were upon.

So the statement of the speaker that the Jamaa’ah of Salafiyyah is one of the Islaamic jamaa’aat, this is an error. The Jamaa’ah of Salafiyyah is the sole Jamaa’ah that it is obligatory to follow, to traverse upon its manhaj, to be affiliated with and to make Jihaad with. And everything else besides it, then it is not permissible for the Muslim to affiliate himself with any of that, because it is in opposition.

So if the person pleased to be affiliated with the opponents to the manhaj of the Salaf? The Muslim is not pleased with this. The Messenger ﷺ said, **“Stick to my Sunnah and the Sunnah of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs after me.”** [^1]

And he ﷺ said, **“Whosoever is upon the likes of what I am upon today, and my Companions.”** [^2] So does a person desire salvation, but he traverses other than its path?

> ‘You hope for salvation, but you do not traverse its path; Indeed, the ship does not sail upon dry land.’
