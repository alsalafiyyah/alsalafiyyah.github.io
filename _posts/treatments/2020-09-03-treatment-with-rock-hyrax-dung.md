Question:

The dung of rock hyrax is used as a cure for many diseases and is sold by spice traders. Is it permissible to use it for treatment?  

Answer:

The rock hyrax is lawful and a Muslim is permitted to hunt it and eat its meat. In principle, the animal whose meat is edible, its dung and urine are lawful to use. Therefore, using the dung of rock hyrax for treatment is legally permissible.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
