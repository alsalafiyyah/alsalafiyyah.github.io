**Question: What is your opinion on the transplantation of human organs which saves the life of many people?**

Answer: I have a reservation with regard to this matter. The Muslim should be respected and taking away any of his organs will cause harm. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**Breaking a dead man's bone is like breaking it when he is alive.**" [^1] 

Thus, I abstain from issuing a Fatwa regarding the ruling of buying and transplanting organs.

**Question: You just abstain but do not prohibit it?**

Answer: Yes, I abstain only. Some scholars permitted transplantation of human organs, as it becomes dust after burial while others, including me, have abstained from judging it.
