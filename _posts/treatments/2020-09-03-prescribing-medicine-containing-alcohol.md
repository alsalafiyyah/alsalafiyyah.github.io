Question:

I want to hear your Fatwa on some medicines that contain alcohol. I am so worried and anxious about the matter. I fear that I am committing a sin when I give patients prescriptions that include these drugs. May Allah reward you!

Answer:

It is not permissible to mix medicines with intoxicant alcohol. However, if the drug contains a small quantity of alcohol that has no effect on color, taste, or smell, it will be permissible to take it. Otherwise, it will not be permissible.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
