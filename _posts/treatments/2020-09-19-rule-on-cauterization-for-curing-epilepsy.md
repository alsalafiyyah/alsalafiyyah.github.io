Question:

An epileptic woman is possessed by a female Jinn. When the Jinn is beaten, she refuses to depart from the Muslim woman's body. Is it permissible in this case to burn the Muslim woman with a firebrand so that the female jinni will leave her body? 

Answer:

It is absolutely Haram (prohibited) to use this method, because only Allah has the right to punish with fire.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions
