Question:

A university student suffers a lot when he makes Wudu' (ablution), as he stays in the bathroom for more than half an hour. Also, when he leaves the bathroom, he feels that drops of urine come out. Is he considered among those who suffer uncontrolled enuresis, so that he must seek treatment? 

Answer:

If the drops of urine are really discharged after Wudu' continuously, it will be enuresis that is already known. If the person imagines that drops of urine come out, this will be considered doubts and whisperings that a Muslim must overlook and seek refuge with Allah from the accursed Satan who casts them. The Shari'ah (Islamic law) orders Muslims who suffers enuresis to seek lawful treatment. The guidance of the Prophet (peace be upon him) was to seek treatment and encourage the patient from among his family and Companions to seek it. 

It was related in Al-Musnad (Hadith compilation) and Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) of Abu Dawud, Al-Tirmidhy and Ibn Majah with an authentic Sanad (chain of narrators) on the authority of Usamah ibn Sharik saying: "**I was with the Prophet (peace be upon him) when some Bedouins came asking, "O Messenger of Allah, should we make use of medical treatment?" He replied, "Yes, O Slaves of Allah! Use medication for treatment, for Allah has not made a disease without appointing a remedy for it, except for one disease." They asked, "What is it?" He (the Prophet) said, "It is old age."**" [^1]
 
May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
