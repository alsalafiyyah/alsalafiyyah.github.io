### Question:
Is it permissible to refuse to treat a mentally and physically retarded person because his treatment will cost a lot of money which can be spent on another patient who can benefit society? It should be mentioned that the retarded patient is of no social benefit and medically he is a burden. Expenditures on such people may reach one million riyals, and these sums could better be spent on others. Not to mention hospital bed fees and the subsequent expenses which affect the treatment of others because of spending on such a patient. This money is from the hospital budget despite the lack of resources.  

### Answer:
It is not permissible to refuse to treat the mentally and physically retarded if the cure is possible, even if his treatment costs a lot as long as it is affordable. Being mentally and physically retarded does not violate his sanctity.
