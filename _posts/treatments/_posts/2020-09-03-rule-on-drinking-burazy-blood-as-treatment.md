Question:

What is the ruling on drinking the blood of the Burazy family belonging to the two tribes of Al-Suhul and Matir if a person is bitten by a frantic animal? Why these two tribes in particular? Why do people not drink the blood of any other tribe? 

Answer:

Just as it is Haram (prohibited) to consume the blood of human beings, it is also Haram to seek cure by means of this blood. The Prophet (peace be upon him) is reported to have forbidden this. He said, "Treat yourselves medically, but use nothing unlawful."[^1] 

Seeking a cure by drinking the blood of any of these two tribes is not known to have a basis in the Shari'ah of Islam. Rather, it is a prohibited and abominable act.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
