Question:

My wife is ill with breast atrophy. Even though the breasts were improving during the period of breastfeeding, they would atrophy soon after. The matter worsened last year with the breasts becoming the same size as a man's. I took her to a Qatari doctor who advised performing a silicone breast implant in order to increase the size of the breast. Attached to my inquiry is a translated case report. I am going through a two-fold problem:

My wife is greatly distressed due to this problem which makes her sense a deprivation of the natural beauty of breasts and her inability to be a source of enjoyment to her husband. I too suffer a lot for not being able to enjoy my wife the way other husbands enjoy their wives, which makes me depressed and upset. This problem is intolerable. Describing the women of Jannah (Paradise), Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And young full-breasted (mature) maidens of equal age**" [al-Naba: 33], This Ayah (Qur'anic verse) indicates the beauty of woman's breasts.

The question now is:
1. Is it permissible for her to have this operation based on the reasons mentioned above?
2. If it is permissible, is it the same to have a silicon breast implant or to inject the breast? I would like to add that the doctor did not mention any side effects. 

Please give me your Fatwa regarding whether to let my wife undergo this treatment or refrain from it. 

Answer:

If the reality is as you mentioned, it will be permissible to perform a silicon breast operation provided that no harm is done to your wife's body. Many texts of Shari`ah support treating such diseases.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
