Question:

Some people drink the milk of domestic donkeys. Whenever I inform them about its prohibition, they argue that prohibited things become permissible during affliction. What is the legal ruling on that? Is Qiyas (analogy) applicable here? Please, advise. May Allah guide you and us to good sayings and deeds.

Answer:

It is not permissible for a Muslim to seek treatment through drinking the milk of the domestic donkeys. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
