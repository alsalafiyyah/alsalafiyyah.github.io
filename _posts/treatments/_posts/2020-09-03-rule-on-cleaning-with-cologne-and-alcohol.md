Question:

What is the ruling on using cologne with alcohol for medical purposes such as a disinfectant for injuries? Also what is the ruling on beer, and what about alcohol-free beer?  

Answer:

There is no harm in using cologne with alcohol for medical purposes such as a disinfectant for injuries. As for beer, if it contains even a small amount of alcohol which causes intoxication in large amount, it is not permissible to drink it. If it is free from alcohol, the basic rule is that all things are lawful.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
