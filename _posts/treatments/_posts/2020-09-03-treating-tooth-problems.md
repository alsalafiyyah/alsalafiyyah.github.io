Question:

Is pulling out natural teeth and replacing them with artificial ones considered an offence of trying to change the creation of Allah? 

Answer:

There is nothing wrong with treating infected or imperfect teeth by extracting them and replacing them with artificial teeth, if necessary, for this is considered lawful treatment to remove harm. This is not considered a change of the creation of Allah as imagined by the questioner, for what is meant by Allah's Fitrah (innate pure nature) in His Saying, "**No change let there be in the creation of Allah**" [al-Rum: 30] is the religion of Islam.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
