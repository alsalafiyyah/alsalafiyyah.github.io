Question:

I came across a medicine called Dentinox in one pharmacy in Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah. This medicine is used for looking after babies' teeth but it contains Khamr (intoxicant) that is called Ethanol in the brochure as chemists know. The brochure concerned is attached to the letter. I hope that you, may Allah keep you safe, will instruct those who import this medicine from the country that makes it i.e. Britain, as this has to be stopped. 

Answer:

We referred the matter to professional chemists and they ascertained the information mentioned in the question that the medicine concerned contains a 10.8% percentage of Ethanol. Consequently, using Dentinox is not permissible for it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said regarding Khamr, "**It is not medicine, but an ailment.**" [^1]

He (peace be upon him) also said, "**Allah has sent down the disease, and He has appointed a cure for every disease; so treat yourselves medically, but use nothing unlawful.**" [^2]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
