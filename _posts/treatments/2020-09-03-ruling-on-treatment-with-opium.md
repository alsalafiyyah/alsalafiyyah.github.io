Question:

Is it permissible to use opium or alcoholic drinks like vinegar as medication for curing illnesses? 

Answer:

It is not permissible to seek treatment through anything that Allah has prohibited, like opium, hashish, alcoholic drinks or any drug or intoxicant of the sort. Mixing lawful medicine with amounts of unlawful things is not permissible. If, however, the small quantity added to the medicine does not cause intoxication, it will be permissible to use. The added quantity is ineffective; therefore, it is as though non-existent. If the vinegar is not made from alcoholic substances or is made but becomes vinegar without being treated, it will not be considered as a narcotic or an intoxicant and it is thus permissible to use it as a medication or be mixed with food. If, however, the vinegar is produced from alcoholic substances and is later treated to become pure vinegar, it is prohibited to adopt such a process or use the resulting vinegar as a medication or mix it with food.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
