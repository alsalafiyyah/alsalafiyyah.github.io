Question:

Is it permissible for a believer to drink Khamr claiming that it relieves some of their pains?

Answer: 

Khamr is Haram (prohibited). It is impermissible to be used as a treatment. A proof for the foregoing is the Hadith in which the Prophet (peace be upon him) says, "**O Allah's servants! Seek treatment, but use nothing unlawful for there is no disease that Allah has created, except that He has also created its treatment.**" [^1]
