Question: 

Why was the translation mentioned above published in a Muslim country taking into account that Muhammad Asad - to my knowledge - is living in the Kingdom of Morocco? I find nothing in the Qur'an or the Sunnah to support the issues mentioned in it. I hope that your Fatwa will back me to refute these matters and prevent the publication of this translation here.

Answer:

The translation referred to contains fatal errors and flagrant false beliefs. As a result, the Constitutional Council of the Muslim World League in Makkah Al-Mukarramah issued a decree banning the print and publication of this translation.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
