### Question:
How many Prophets and Messengers (peace be upon them) were there?

### Answer: 
No one knows their number except Allah, because Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And, indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): of some of them We have related to you their story. And of some We have not related to you their story**" [Ghafir: 78]

Those who are known are those who are mentioned in the Qur'an or authentically reported in the Sunnah.
