Question:

How many Prophets and Messengers (peace be upon them) were there?

Answer: 

No one knows their number except Allah, because Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And, indeed We have sent Messengers before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم): of some of them We have related to you their story. And of some We have not related to you their story**" [Ghafir: 78]

Those who are known are those who are mentioned in the Qur'an or authentically reported in the Sunnah.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
