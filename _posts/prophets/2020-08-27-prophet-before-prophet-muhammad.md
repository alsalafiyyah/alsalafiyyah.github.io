Question: 

Who was the prophet and messenger sent before the Last Messenger; our Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him)?

Answer:

He was Jesus ('Isa), the son of Mariam (peace be upon him). It was authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**I am the nearest of all the people to the son of Mary (i.e. Jesus) for there has been no prophet between me and him.**" [^1]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
