Question: 

Is it true that `Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) is still alive in the third heaven? Was he not crucified? Will he return to earth once again? Will he return as a prophet or as an ordinary person?

Answer:

Isa (peace be upon him) was neither crucified nor killed, as Allah says, "**...but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ‘Isâ (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)]**" (Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 157). He was raised alive to heaven, body and soul, as Allah says, "**But Allâh raised him [‘Isâ (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he (peace be upon him) is in the heavens).**" (Surah Al-Nisa', 4: 158). He is going to descend at the end of time as a just ruler to break the crucifix, kill the pig, and rule according to the Shari`ah of Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
