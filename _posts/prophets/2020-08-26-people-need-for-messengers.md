Question:

In light of being honored with faculties of reason and natural disposition, do humans stand in need of Prophets? If 'yes', why are the prophets human beings?

Answer: 

Indeed, humankind are in dire need for the messengers, as human beings minds differ greatly in reason. Moreover, they are unable to recognize - independently - the words and deeds that please or displease Allah (Glorified be He). It was for this reason that Allah sent forth His Messengers starting with Nuh (Noah) (peace be upon him) up to Muhammad, the seal of Prophets. Muhammad was sent to the whole of mankind with a perfect and comprehensive religion that will remain effective and valid to the Last Day.

We advise you to recite the Qur'an regularly and to contemplate its meanings, especially when reciting Ayahs (verses) on stories of the Prophets; how they conveyed the messages and served the purposes for which they were sent. These purposes are defined in the Qur'anic Ayah (verse) in which Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And We did not send any Messenger before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) but We revealed to him (saying): Lâ ilâha illa Ana [none has the right to be worshipped but I (Allâh)], so worship Me (Alone and none else).**" [al-Anbiya: 25]

Sending a Messenger in a human form is more convincing in establishing proofs. Since mankind and Messengers belong to the same race, they can understand each other. People can ask them questions about matters of concern and Messengers can give them answers that they comprehend. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And nothing prevented men from believing when the guidance came to them, except that they said: "Has Allâh sent a man as (His) Messenger?" Say: "If there were on the earth, angels walking about in peace and security, We should certainly have sent down for them from the heaven an angel as a Messenger.**" [al-Isra: 94-95]

Allah says also: "**And We sent not a Messenger except with the language of his people, in order that he might make (the Message) clear for them.**" [Ibrahim: 4]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
