### Question:
Dear brother, Shaykh 'Abdul-'Aziz ibn Baz I am a director and scenarist. I recently thought of producing a new movie entitled (A Man from Babel) about the life story of Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him). After reading the book written by Tunisian writers and other nationals, I wrote the scenario and the script for the movie. Then I heard in the Saudi Educational Centre in Tunisia that the Deputy Minister of Information is visiting Tunisia to attend a meeting held by the Arab Broadcasting Corporation, so I welcomed him.

### Answer: 
It is not permissible to act the messengers and the prophets, which will be necessary to film their stories. Therefore, it is not permissible to do so, because of the evil consequences it produces. A decree was issued by the Council of Senior Scholars in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia about this issue that declared the prohibition of this matter.
