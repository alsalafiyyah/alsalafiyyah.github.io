Question:

What is the ruling on he who denies that Ibrahim (Abraham) (peace be upon him) was thrown in the fire and says that his enemies conspired against him to do that but Allah disclosed their conspiracies?

Answer: 

Legal texts prove that the enemies of Ibrahim (peace be upon him) conspired to harm him. Allah (Exalted be He) told us that they said: "**Build for him a building (it is said that the building was like a furnace) and throw him into the blazing fire!**" [al-Saffat: 97] 

"**And Burn him and help your âlihah (gods), if you will be doing.**" [al-Anbiya: 68]

Allah's saying: "**We (Allâh) said: "O fire! Be you coolness and safety for Ibrâhîm (Abraham)!" denotes that they carried out their conspiracies against Ibrahim (peace be upon him) by throwing him in the fire. But Allah (Glorified be He) made it cool and safe for Ibrahim.**" [al-Anbiya: 69]

The authentic Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) proves this fact in detail. Anyone who denies that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) was thrown into the fire and allegorically interpreted texts mentioned in this regard saying that they meant only conspiracy and machination is a disbeliever as they belie the Qur'an and the authentic Sunnah. Moreover, they say what they do not know about Allah and disbelieve the Ayahs (verses) of the Qur'an and Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him). They also contradict common knowledge of Islam upon which the Ummah (nation) consensually agreed.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
