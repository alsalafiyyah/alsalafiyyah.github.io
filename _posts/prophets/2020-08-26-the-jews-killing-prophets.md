Question:

He misinterpreted the verses declaring that the Israelites murdered their prophets and rejected them under the claim that they were just attempts to kill but no crime took place?

Answer: 

Allah explicitly states in the Qur'an that the Jews killed the prophets unjustly. Allah does not mention - even in one verse - any evidence explicitly or implicitly in support of the claim that the Jews only attempted to kill their prophets or only injured them without actually killing them. Allah stated: "**And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the Wrath of Allâh. That was because they used to disbelieve the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations etc.) of Allâh and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allâh, i.e. commit crimes and sins).**" [al-Baqarah: 61]

Allah also stated: "**Verily! Those who disbelieve in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh and kill the Prophets without right, and kill those men who order just dealings, ... then announce to them a painful torment.**" [Aal Imran: 21]

"**Indignity is put over them wherever they may be, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allâh, and from men; they have drawn on themselves the Wrath of Allâh, and destruction is put over them. This is because they disbelieved in the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh and killed the Prophets without right. This is because they disobeyed (Allâh) and used to**" [Aal Imran: 112]

He (Exalted be He) further stated, "**Because of their breaking the covenant, and of their rejecting the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allâh, and of their killing the Prophets unjustly**" [al-Nisa: 155] 

Therefore, whoever interprets the killings mentioned in these Ayahs to mean mere injuries or attempts to kill is wrongful and distorting the Book of Allah unjustly to defend the claims of his 'brothers' among the Jews . He thus chooses disbelief and rejects faith.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
