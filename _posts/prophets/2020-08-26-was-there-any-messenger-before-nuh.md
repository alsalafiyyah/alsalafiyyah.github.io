Question:

Allah sent 313 messengers; the first of them was Nuh (Noah) and the last was Muhammad. Was there a messenger sent before Nuh?

Answer: 

Prophet Nuh was the first messenger sent to the people on earth after Adam. This is based on the long Hadith of intercession narrated in the Two Sahihs. The believers went to Nuh and said to him: "You are the first Messenger that Allah has sent on earth, so can you intercede for us..."

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
