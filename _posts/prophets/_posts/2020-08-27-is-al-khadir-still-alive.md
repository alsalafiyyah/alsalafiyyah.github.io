Question: 

 Is Al-Khadir (peace be upon him) still alive as is claimed?

Answer:

The most authentic of the two opinions of scholars is that of the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars) who said that Al-Khadir (peace be upon him) has died. This is based on the general rule in the saying of Allah (Exalted be He): "**And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم.) **" [al-Anbiya: 34]

It was reported that Ibn 'Umar said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) prayed one of the 'Isha' (Night) prayers in his last days and after finishing it with Taslim, he stood up and said: "**Do you realize (the importance of) this night? Nobody present on the surface of the earth tonight would be living after the completion of one hundred years from this night. Ibn 'Umar said: People did not understand these words of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) which had been uttered pertaining to one hundred years. Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) in fact meant (by these words) that on that day none from amongst those who had been living upon the earth (from amongst his Companions) would survive (after one hundred years) and that would be the end of that generation.**" [^1] 

This Hadith was reported by Muslim. This is the dominant basis in Allah's laws for mankind. Therefore, we have to stick to this basis as long as there is no evidence that proves that Al-Khadir (peace be upon him) is exempted from that rule.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
