Question: 

Why was 'Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary) called Al-Masih (Christ)?

Answer:

'Isa is called **Al-Masih** because any sick person whom he wiped over (**masaha**) would be healed by the Will of Allah. Some of the Salaf (righteous predecessors) said that he was called **Masih** because of his travel for the sake of calling people to religion. According to those two sayings, **Masih** means the present participle of the verb **Masaha**. It was said that he was called **Masih** because he had no sole in his feet. It was also said that he was called so because he was wiped with blessings or purified from the sins, and therefore he was blessed. According to these last two sayings, **Masih** is the passive participle of the verb **Masaha**. The first two sayings are the most authentic. Allah knows the best.

In any case, no creed or deed is dependent upon adopting any of these sayings. Therefore, learning these matters is insignificant or useless.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
