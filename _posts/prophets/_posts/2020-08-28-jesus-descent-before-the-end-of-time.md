Question: 

There are authentic Hadiths regarding the return of Prophet 'Isa (peace be upon him). Are these Hadiths ranked as Hadith-ul-Ahad (Hadith which at some point in the chain has only a single narrator)? Is there an explicit text in the Qur'an about the return of `Isa, the Son of Maryam, (peace be upon him)? If he comes back, will he be a prophet or a messenger? I appreciate it if you recommend some useful books to provide further details on this issue.

Answer:

First of all, there are authentic Hadiths confirming the descent of Prophet `Isa, the Son of Maryam, (peace be upon him) who was raised to heaven alive. Regardless of being Hadith-ul-Ahad or Hadith Mutawatir (a Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible), there is nothing wrong with taking them as evidence.

Secondly, there are Qur'anic texts indicating that 'Isa was raised to heaven alive and that he will come down as a prophet and a messenger because he was a prophet before his ascent. However, he will not call to his Shari`ah; rather, he will call to the Islamic principles conveyed by all the prophets and messengers and to the branches conveyed by the Seal of the Messengers, Muhammad (peace be upon him). Thus, there will not be a new message or prophecy that abrogates the last message of Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
