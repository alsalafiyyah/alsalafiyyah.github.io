Question: 

Is Prophet 'Isa (peace be upon him) still alive until now? Did he die like other prophets? What motivates me to ask this question is that one of the scholars in Kenya issued a Fatwa that says that 'Isa (peace be upon him) died like the rest of all prophets. He has also mentioned many proofs such as Surah Al-'Imran: 144 and Surah Al-Anbiya': 34. He also used as evidence Sahih Al-Bukhari: vol. 3, p. 79 concerning the exegesis of Allah's saying: "**I will take you**" [Aal Imran: 55] 

The Mufti (Islamic scholar qualified to issue legal opinions) also said that this is the opinion of Imam Malik (may Allah be Merciful to him) in his book Majma' Al-Bihar Al-Anwar. He also referred to the book titled Nazharat Fi Al-Qur'an, by Muhammad Al-Ghazali, p.37-44. The Mufti said that the Qur'an denies only the murder and the crucifixion of 'Isa. Moreover, [Al-Qadyaniyyah](/sufism/) also adhered to this Fatwa from the time it was issued as it was the case in Kenya and its neighboring countries. Furthermore, I am worried about this Fatwa because I believe that 'Isa is still alive and that he will descend at the end of the time. Guide me to the truth! May Allah reward you well!

Answer:

Proofs from the Qur'an and the Sunnah confirm that 'Isa (peace be upon him) was not murdered or crucified, and did not die as well. He is still alive until the present time. Allah has raised him to the heavens. He will descend at the end of the time to break the cross, kill swine, and call people to the truth. People, even the Jews and Christians, will believe in him when he descends. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**...but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ‘Isâ (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)] to But Allâh raised him [‘Isâ (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he عليه السلام is in the heavens). And Allâh is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise. And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must believe in him [‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), as only a Messenger of Allâh and a human being] before his [‘Isâ (Jesus) عليه السلام) or a Jew’s or a Christian’s] death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death). And on the Day of Resurrection, he [‘Isâ (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.**" [al-Nisa: 157-159]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
