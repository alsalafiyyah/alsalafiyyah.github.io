Question: 

In several Islamic countries many Muslims, as well as [Sufi](/sufism/) leaders think that Al-Khadir, the man Allah directed Prophet Musa (Moses) (peace be upon him) to seek knowledge from, is still alive until today. They think that he wanders throughout the world, takes on different forms, has no shadow and is accompanied by Prophet Elias (peace be upon him). Common Muslims think that if Al-Khadir visits and invokes for them, they will get rich at once. But if he gets angry with them, they will be poor after being rich and sick after being healthy. Among their deviant beliefs, I seek refuge with Allah (Exalted be He), is that Al-Khadir may come in the guise of a beggar or a sick person with pus dripping from his body. If someone drives him away, it will be a sign of misfortune and suffering for him. However, if he is welcomed and given medicine, he will vanish leaving no trace and it will be a sign of good fortune for his hosts. 

Is Al-Khadir, who is famous for his encounters with Prophet Musa (peace be upon him), still alive at present? Is he a prophet? Does the authentic Prophetic Hadith clearly state the reality of Al-Khadir?

Answer:

According to the preponderant view held by the Jumhur (dominant majority of scholars), Al-Khadir died. This conclusion can be implied from the apparent meaning of the Ayah: "And We granted not to any human being immortality before you (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم)." [al-Anbiya: 34]

Moreover, it was authentically reported from Ibn 'Umar that he said: "**The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) led us in 'Isha (Night) Prayer one night towards the end of his life, then he stood up and said, 'Do you see this night of yours? One hundred years from now not one of those who are on the face of the earth now will stay alive.' Ibn 'Umar said, 'People were frightened and kept discussing the statement of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in an attempt to understand its meaning. I understood that the Prophet (peace be upon him) predicted that none of the people living on earth at that time would be alive one hundred years later.'**" (Related by Muslim) [^1]

Additionally, the general rule is that all the sons of Adam are going to die. As far as we know, there is no evidence affirming that Al-Khadir (peace be upon him) is an exception. Therefore, we should accept this until the contrary is proved through an authentic proof.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
