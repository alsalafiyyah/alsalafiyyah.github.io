Question:

It is mentioned in the books of the biographies of the Prophet that Isma`il (Ishmael) (peace be upon him) was buried in Al-Hatim in Makkah Al-Mukarramah. If the grave is in Al-Hatim, how is it permissible to offer Salah (Prayer) there?

Answer: 

The claim that Isma'il (peace be upon him) was buried in Al-Hatim is incorrect and totally unreliable .

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
