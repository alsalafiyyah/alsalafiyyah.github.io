Question: 

I would like to benefit from the knowledge of Your Eminence to clear my heart, Allah (Exalted and Glorified be He) says: "**So ask the people of the Scripture, if you do not know.**" [al-Nahl: 43] Allah (Exalted be He), is the Protector of the Truth and Rightness, and to Him is the resort and return. After I studied various branches of Islamic religion, such as sciences of Hadith and Qur'an, I became certain that the person who threw Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) (peace be upon him and our prophet) in fire was not Al-Namrud who - as known and mentioned in exegesis and history books of Islamic scholars - reigned the earth at the time . Rather, he was thrown in by his own people, because whenever the incident is mentioned in the Great Qur'an to which Falsehood cannot come from before or behind, there is a declaration that this incident took place with his people and father, as they were idol worshipers. Ibrahim (peace be upon him and our Prophet) kept preventing them to do so till he broke their idols into pieces. Consequently, they punished him by throwing him into the fire. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**They said: "Build for him a building (it is said that the building was like a furnace) and throw him into the blazing fire!"**" [al-Saffat: 97] in addition to other Ayahs. The people who approved and implemented this punishment after discussing it with him were his people according to the context, in addition to the fact that the reference of pronouns to them declares that this incident took place with his people not with Al-Namrud. 

It is right that the incident stated in Allah's saying (Exalted be He): "**Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrâhîm (Abraham)**" [al-Baqarah: 258 indicates its occurrence with Al-Namrud not with Ibrahim's people, even though it is historically known that Al-Namrud was not from the people of Ibrahim (peace be upon him). In light of the unquestionable Qur'anic context, as well as books of history, exegesis and weak Hadiths, I have become worried and confused. I have checked books of exegesis, but never found a solution to this dilemma. Therefore, I hope that Your Eminence will relieve my worries by answering this question according to authentic Hadiths and opinions of great scholars in this regard. Appreciate your guidance, may Allah reward you!

Answer:

Allah (Exalted be He) cites in Surah Al-Baqarah the story of the man who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord (Allah), and concludes it with Ibrahim's triumph over him and refutation of his suspicious argument. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allâh guides not the people, who are Zâlimûn (wrong-doers.).**" [al-Baqarah: 258] However, Allah (Glorified be He) does not mention that Ibrahim was hurt or warned of any harm by the man in this story.

In Surahs of Al-An'am, Al-Anbiya', Al-Shu'ara' and Al-'Ankabut, Allah (Exalted be He) states the Da`wah (call to religion) of Ibrahim Al-Khalil (The close servant to Allah) to his father and people for Oneness of Allah, resisting their worship of other than Allah. Ibrahim (peace be upon him) also broke their idols and argued with his people, who consequently threw him into the fire, but Allah rescued him. 

Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**They said: "Burn him and help your âlihah (gods), if you will be doing." We (Allâh) said: "O fire! Be you coolness and safety for Ibrâhîm (Abraham)!" And they wanted to harm him, but We made them the worst losers. And We rescued him and Lût (Lot) to the land which We have blessed for the ‘Alamîn (mankind and jinn).**" [al-Anbiya: 68-71]

Accordingly, this means that Ibrahim's people threw him into the fire, but Allah (Exalted be He) foiled their plot and made their efforts vain, as He rescued His Khalil (A Close Servant to Allah) Ibrahim (peace be upon him) from their destruction. So, there is no dilemma or doubt regarding this. What is intended here is to clarify that Ibrahim (peace be upon him) conveyed the message plainly, and established proof against the Kafirun (disbelievers), and that he was befallen by this great affliction and endured it all for the sake of Allah. Therefore, Allah saved him from the fire and warded off the plot of the Kafirun. This was not to happen except by Allah's Bounty and Mercy. Thus, do not push yourself too hard, rather think of what is more important. May Allah increase your knowledge and keenness in religion, and may He guide us to beneficial knowledge and righteous acts and make you and us beneficial to all Muslims.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
