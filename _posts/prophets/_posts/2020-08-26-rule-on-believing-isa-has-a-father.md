Question:

 It is claimed that 'Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) had a father, and believing that he was born without a father is not a part of the Islamic `Aqidah (creed).

Answer: 

The claim that 'Isa (peace be upon him) had a father contradicts the text of the Qur'an, which states that 'Isa's mother had kept her virginity and that she had never been touched by a man, as Allah says: "**(Remember) when the angels said: "O Maryam (Mary)! Verily, Allâh gives you the glad tidings of a Word ["Be!" - and he was! i.e. ‘Isâ (Jesus) the son of Maryam (Mary)] from Him, his name will be the Messiah ‘Isâ (Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), held in honour in this world and in the Hereafter, and will be one of those who are near to Allâh." "He will speak to the people in the cradle and in manhood, and he will be one of the righteous." She said: "O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me." He said: "So (it will be) for Allâh creates what He wills. When He has decreed something, He says to it only: "Be!" - and it is.**" (Surah Al `Imran, 3:45-47)

Allah (Exalted be He) also says: "**And mention in the Book (the Qur’ân, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Ruh [angel Jibrîl (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects. She said: "Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allâh) from you, if you do fear Allâh." (The angel) said: "I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son." She said: "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?" He said: "So (it will be), your Lord said: ‘That is easy for Me (Allâh): And (We wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and a mercy from Us (Allâh), and it is a matter (already) decreed, (by Allâh).’ " So she conceived him, and she withdrew with him to a far place (i.e. Bethlehem valley about 4-6 miles from Jerusalem).**" (Surah Maryam, 19:16-22) 

And Allah (Exalted be He) also says: "**And Maryam (Mary), the daughter of ‘Imrân who guarded her chastity. And We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our Rûh [i.e. Jibrîl (Gabriel)], and she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord [i.e. believed in the Words of Allâh: "Be!" - and he was; that is ‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) as a Messenger of Allâh], and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qânitûn (i.e. obedient to Allâh).**" (Surah Al-Tahrim, 66:12) 

These Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) establish her virginity, her innocence of Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), and confirm that she was never touched by a man and that 'Isa (peace be upon him) is the Word and Sign of Allah that was sent to Maryam. They show that her pregnancy was initiated by Jibril (Gabriel) blowing into her, by the Permission and Order of Allah. Anyone who denies this, and claims that 'Isa had both a father and a mother, is a Kafir (disbeliever) and disbelieves in the Ayahs revealed by Allah. They are either accusing Maryam of Zina, as the Jews did, or claiming that 'Isa (peace be upon him) is the son of Allah, as the Christians do.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
