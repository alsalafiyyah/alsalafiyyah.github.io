Question:

Does the word Asbat (Descendants of Jacob) mentioned in the Qur'an include Prophet Yusuf's (Joseph) brothers who threw him into the bottom of a well? If they were Prophets, how could their course of action with Yusuf be justified? Or did they plot against him before they were chosen for prophethood?

Answer: 

Yusuf (peace be upon him) and his brothers are the sons of Ya'qub (Jacob) - also known as Israel - (peace be upon him). In the Qur'an, the word "Al-Asbat" refers to the grandchildren of Ya`qub and his twelve sons, only of whom Yusuf (peace be upon him) was a Prophet. This is the most authentic view which Ibn Kathir adopted in his book entitled Al-Bidayah, (pp. 215-216, vol. 1). In light of this view, the possibility of Yusuf's brothers scheming against him after deceiving their father into agreeing to let Yusuf accompany them cannot be ruled out.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
