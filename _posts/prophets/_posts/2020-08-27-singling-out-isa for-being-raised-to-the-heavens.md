Question: 

As Muhammad (peace be upon him) is the best of Prophets, why was he not raised to the heavens instead of 'Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him), if the latter was actually raised? Why is 'Isa in particular, among all the prophets, the one who was raised? Please give reason for this.

Answer:

Allah (Exalted be He) encompasses everything with His Mercy and Knowledge, and He surrounds all things with His Power. He has profound wisdom, powerful will and omnipotence; He chose from the people prophets and Messengers who were sent as bearers of glad tidings and warners; He raised some of them above others in degree; and He granted each of them the privileges He wanted, out of His benevolence and mercy. He honored Ibrahim (Abraham, peace be upon him) and Muhammad (peace be upon him) with His friendship; and gave each prophet the signs and miracles which befit their eras, and by which the evidence is established for their people, out of His wisdom and justice; there is no stopping for His Judgment, and He is the Almighty, the All-Wise, the Most Subtle and the Acquainted. Not every privilege in itself is a reason for preference, as 'Isa was privileged with being raised to the heavens alive according to the will and wisdom of Allah, not for being better than the other Messengers such as Ibrahim, Muhammad, Musa (Moses) and Nuh (peace be upon them). 

They were given other privileges which entail their preference over him. The reference in this matter is Allah who disposes the affairs as He wants; He cannot be questioned as to what He does, as He is Omniscient and All-Wise.

Moreover, asking about this has nothing to do with deeds or 'Aqidah (creed), but it rather afflicts a person with confusion and doubts. A believer should take all the affairs related to Allah for granted, and exert effort in the affairs related to people, whether in 'Aqidah or in deeds. This is the method of prophets and Messengers, and the way of the Rightly-Guided Caliphs and the guided Salaf (righteous predecessors) of the Ummah (nation). 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
