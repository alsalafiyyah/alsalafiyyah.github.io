Question: 

Is Al-Khadir a prophet or a righteous man?

Answer:

The correct opinion is that Al-Khadir (peace be upon him) is a prophet. This is based on his story with Musa (peace be upon him) narrated in Surah Al-Kahf (The Cave). Allah (Exalted be He) states that Al-Khadir scuttled the boat owned by poor fishermen, killed an apparently innocent boy, and built a wall for two orphan boys in a village whose people refused to feed them. After much criticism on the part of Musa, Al-Khadir explained the reasons for what he had done.

The story ended with Al-Khadir's declaration that all he had done was revealed to him by Allah, as Allah (Exalted be He) informs in the Qur'an: And "**I did them not of my own accord. That is the interpretation of those (things) over which you could not hold patience.**" [al-Kahf: 82]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
