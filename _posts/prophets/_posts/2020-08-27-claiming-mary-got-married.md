Question: 

An Egyptian doctor working in Britain told me that Maryam (Mary, peace be upon her), the daughter of 'Imran got married to a man after she gave birth to `Isa and that she bore this man two children. Is this true? If it is true, what is the evidence from the Holy Qur'an or the Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet)? Since that Egyptian doctor was unable to bring any evidence, please explain this issue.

Answer:

There is nothing in the Qur'an nor in the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) to indicate that Maryam bint 'Imran got married after 'Isa (peace be upon him) was born. There is also no evidence to the effect that she bore any children other than 'Isa (peace be upon him).

Before she gave birth to 'Isa, she was not known to have been touched by a man or to have been unchaste. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And mention in the Book (the Qur’ân, O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم the story of) Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in seclusion from her family to a place facing east. She placed a screen (to screen herself) from them; then We sent to her Our Ruh [angel Jibrîl (Gabriel)], and he appeared before her in the form of a man in all respects. She said: "Verily! I seek refuge with the Most Gracious (Allâh) from you, if you do fear Allâh." (The angel) said: "I am only a messenger from your Lord, (to announce) to you the gift of a righteous son." She said: "How can I have a son, when no man has touched me, nor am I unchaste?"**" [Maryam: 16-20] Allah (Exalted be He) has confirmed her truthfulness.

Thus, It becomes clear that the claim that Maryam bint 'Imran got married or bore children other than `Isa (peace be upon him) is groundless.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
