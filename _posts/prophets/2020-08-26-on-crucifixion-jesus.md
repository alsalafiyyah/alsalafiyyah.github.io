### Question:
Can you tell us about the claim that 'Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) was crucified but did not die on the Cross.

### Answer: 
Allah (Exalted be He) spoke about the claim of the Jews that they killed 'Isa (peace be upon him), the son of Maryam (Mary, peace be upon her). Allah (Exalted be He) refuted this alleged claim stating explicitly that 'Isa was neither killed nor crucified. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And because of their saying (in boast), "We killed Messiah ‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of Allâh," - but they killed him not, nor crucified him, but it appeared so to them [the resemblance of ‘Isâ (Jesus) was put over another man (and they killed that man)], and those who differ therein are full of doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but conjecture. For surely; they killed him not [i.e. ‘Isâ (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary) عليهما السلام]: But Allâh raised him [‘Isâ (Jesus)] up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and he عليه السلام is in the heavens). And Allâh is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.**" [al-Nisa: 157-158]

Whoever claims that 'Isa (peace be upon him) was crucified or killed is a Kafir as he will be opposing the explicit texts of the Qur'an.
