### Question:
What is the wisdom behind sending the prophets and messengers over sporadic periods of time? Why were they not sent in the same time period?

### Answer: 
Allah (Exalted be He) is All-Wise, thus He sent His prophets and messengers over periods of time. He chose them and sent them whenever people were in need of them to guide whoever had gone astray and save them from Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and mischief spreading among them. Nevertheless, some prophets and messengers were sent within the same interval of time, such as Dawud (David) and Sulayman (Solomon), Ibrahim (Abraham) and Lut (Lot), Musa (Moses) and Harun (Aaron).
