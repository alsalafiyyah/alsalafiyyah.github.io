### Question:
Does the word Asbat (Descendants of Jacob) mentioned in the Qur'an include Prophet Yusuf's (Joseph) brothers who threw him into the bottom of a well? If they were Prophets, how could their course of action with Yusuf be justified? Or did they plot against him before they were chosen for prophethood?

### Answer: 
Yusuf (peace be upon him) and his brothers are the sons of Ya'qub (Jacob) - also known as Israel - (peace be upon him). In the Qur'an, the word "Al-Asbat" refers to the grandchildren of Ya'qub and his twelve sons, only of whom Yusuf (peace be upon him) was a Prophet. This is the most authentic view which Ibn Kathir adopted in his book entitled Al-Bidayah, (pp. 215-216, vol. 1). In light of this view, the possibility of Yusuf's brothers scheming against him after deceiving their father into agreeing to let Yusuf accompany them cannot be ruled out.
