Question: 

What are the causes of hardheartedness and how can we cure it?

Answer:

The causes of hardheartedness include sins, being heedless and befriending the heedless and the dissolute. Conversely, obeying Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He), befriending good people, busying oneself with reciting Qur'an, Dhikr (remembrance of Allah) and asking Allah's Forgiveness soften the heart and bring tranquility. Allah (Exalted be He) states, "**...verily, in the remembrance of Allâh do hearts find rest.**" [al-Ra'ad: 28]
