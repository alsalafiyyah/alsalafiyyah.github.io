Question:

I would like to know the ruling on making a model for Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn (the Two Sacred Mosques i.e. The Holy Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet's Mosque in Madinah) including the Sacred Ka`bah with the aim of selling them to the pilgrims and other Muslims who wish to buy them as souvenirs.

Answer: 

It is not permissible to make scale models for Al-Haramayn Al-Sharifayn as they may contain pictures of the people in Al-Masjid Al-Haram (the Sacred Mosque in Makkah) while making Tawaf (circumambulation of the Ka`bah) or offering Salah (Prayer) and of the people in Al-Masjid Al-Nabawy (the Prophet’s Mosque in Al-Madinah), the reciters and others, also because the green dome appears in the picture of Al-Masjid Al-Nabawy which makes some people believe in domes and the people buried in them and this may lead to Al-Shirk-ul-Akbar (major form of associating others in worship with Allah) and other evils; may Allah save us from that.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
