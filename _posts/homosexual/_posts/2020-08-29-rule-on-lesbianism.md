Question: 

What is the ruling on lesbianism and masturbation?

Answer:

Lesbianism is Haram (prohibited), and is a major sin because it is an act that contradicts the Ayahs (Qur'anic verses): "**And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors;**" [al-Mu'minun: 5-7]

Similarly, masturbation is Haram because of the above-mentioned Ayahs and due to the harm it causes. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
