Question: 

I intended many times to practice sodomy, but I did not. Allah, all praise and thank are due to Him, has protected me against this heinous crime. After repenting, I hope you can guide me as to what I should do.

Answer:

Thank Allah for protecting you against the crime of sodomy. Seek Allah's forgiveness and do many good deeds.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
