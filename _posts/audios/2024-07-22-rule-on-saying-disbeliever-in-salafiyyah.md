### Question: 
What is your opinion, Oh virtuous Shaikh, about the one who says: that he is a disbeliever in Salafiyyah?

### Answer: 
This is ignorance and trespassing the truth. If he intends that using this term is not necessary and that it is not necessary for a person to say: I am Salafi, then the affair is easy. If he intends by it that he is a disbeliever in the methodology of the Salaf, their path and the truth which they were upon, then this disbelief in the Book and Sunnah and what the Salaf of this nation were upon.
