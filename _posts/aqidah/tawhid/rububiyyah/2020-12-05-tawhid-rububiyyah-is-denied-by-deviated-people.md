Question:

As the communists and atheists of today deny Allah's Existence, is this not considered a denial of Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Allah's Lordship) and thus it contradicts what some scholars mentioned that no Kafir (disbeliever) has ever denied Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah? 

Answer:

Scholars mentioned that Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah is acknowledged by all nations and only denied by deviated and disregarded people such as the Magi who claimed that there are two gods; a god of light and a god of darkness, that the god of light is greater than the god of darkness, and that the god of light created goodness while the god of darkness created evil. As for denying entirely the existence of Allah (Exalted be He), this was done stubbornly by pharaoh and ancient philosophers. On the other hand, it is well known that the atheists believe in orbits as gods whose paths are monitoring the universe. 

However, the majority of Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) believe that there is a Lord who creates, sustains, and who is above His Creation. They believe that the practices of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) that they indulge in draw them closer to their Lord. On the other hand, the Kafirs (disbelievers) of Quraysh denied resurrection though they believed in Allah as their Lord and Creator. However, they associated others with Allah in His Worship and said: "**There is nothing but our life of this world! We die and we live!**" [Al-Jathiyah: 24] 

The Kafirs also denied Jannah (Paradise) and Fire. Allah thus sent His Messenger Muhammad (peace be upon him) to those disbelievers of Quraysh as well as all other Jinn (creatures created from fire) and human beings to guide them to the truth and forbid them to continue in their falsehood. Only those whom Allah wanted to be granted happiness believed in the Prophet while the majority of people did not believe in him as was the case with all other prophets. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And most of mankind will not believe even if you desire it eagerly.**" [Yusuf: 103] 

And: "**And indeed Iblîs (Satan) did prove true his thought about them: and they followed him, all except a group of true believers (in the Oneness of Allâh).**" [Saba': 20] 

There are many other Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) to the same effect.
