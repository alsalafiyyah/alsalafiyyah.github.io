Question: 

What is the meaning of Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah and Tawhid-ul-Uluhiyyah?

Answer: 

The meaning of Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Allah's Lordship) is the ascription of all Acts of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) to none but Him Alone, such as: creation, bringing into being, providing sustenance, giving life, and causing death.

The meaning of Tawhid-ul-Uluhiyyah (Oneness of Worship) is the dedication of all acts of the servants to none but Allah Alone, such as: Du'a (supplication), asking help, seeking refuge, fear, hope, reliance and all other forms of 'Ibadah (worship).
