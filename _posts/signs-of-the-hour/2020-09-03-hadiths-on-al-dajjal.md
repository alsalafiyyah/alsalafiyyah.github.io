Question: 

Are there any Hadiths mentioning the appearance of Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist)? Are these Hadiths ranked as Sahih (a Hadith that has been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish), Hasan (a Hadith whose chain of narration contains a narrator with weak exactitude, but is free from eccentricity or blemish), or Da'if (a Hadith that fails to reach the status of Hasan, due to a weakness in the chain of narration or one of the narrators)? 

Answer:

There are Hadiths that are Sahih and Mutawatir (Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) about the appearance of Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal. His appearance is one of the Signs of the Hour. For more information on this subject, you should refer to Hadith books such as, the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim), Jami' Al-'Usul, and other reliable books of Hadith.
