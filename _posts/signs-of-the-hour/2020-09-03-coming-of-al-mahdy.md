Question: 

I would like to know the validity of the existence of Al-Mahdy who will appear on earth. Are there any authentic Hadiths about him? May Allah reward you! 

Answer:

There are many Hadiths that indicate the emergence of Al-Mahdy. They were reported in many chains of transmission. A group of scholars said that these Hadiths are morally Mutawatir (a Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) like Abu Al-Hasan Al-Ajurry who is one of the scholars of the fourth century, Al-Safariny in his book Lawami' Al-Anwar Al-Bahiyyah and Al-Shawkany in a booklet that he called Al-Tawdih Fi Tawatur Ahadith Al-Mahdy Wa Al-Dajjal Wa Al-Masih. There are other famous signs mentioned in other Hadiths.

The most important of which is: "**He will spread justice on earth after it was full of injustice and oppression.**" [^1]

No one is permitted to assert that so-and-so is Al-Mahdy until other required signs that were pointed out by the Prophet (peace be upon him) in sound Hadiths become well-known. The most important of these signs is that: "**He will spread justice on earth...**" [^2]
