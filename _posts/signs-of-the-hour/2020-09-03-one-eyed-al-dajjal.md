Question: 

Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist) is mentioned in many Hadiths, what is the meaning of Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist)? Does he exist now or not? Where does he live? What is meant by being one-eyed as the Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned? Is he actually one-eyed or is it a metaphor? Please explain this matter to us, may Allah reward you with Paradise! 

Answer:

The word Al-Dajjal is derived from the Arabic verb "dajal" meaning "to lie" to demonstrate his lying as he will claim lordship which is one of the gravest lies.[^1] 

Al-Masih Al-Dajjal (The Antichrist) exists now and he is actually one-eyed, for the basic ruling states that the literal meaning takes precedence over other possible meanings, unless the opposite is proved. The appearance of Al-Masih Al-Dajjal is authentically reported in the Sahih (a Hadith that has been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish) and Mutawatir (A Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) Hadiths reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him).
