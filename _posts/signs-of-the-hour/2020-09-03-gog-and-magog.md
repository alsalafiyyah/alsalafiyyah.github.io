Question: 

Are Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog) from Banu Adam (human beings, descendents from Prophet Adam)? 

Answer:

Ya'juj and Ma'juj are two great nations from the descendents of Prophet Adam (peace be upon him). At the end of time, they will emerge and will cause mischief. Allah (Exalted be He) will destroy them all in one night when 'Isa (Jesus - peace be upon him), the son of Mary, descends. Their appearance is one of the major signs of the Hour as mentioned in the Qur'an and the authentic Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet). There are many Hadith that indicate that they are from the descendents of Adam (peace be upon him).

It was authentically reported on the authority of Abu Sa'id Al-Khudry (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "**Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says on the Day of Resurrection, 'O Adam.' Adam will reply, 'O Lord! Labbayk wa Sa'dayk (I respond to Your Call and I am happy to serve You).' Allah says, 'Bring out the people of the Fire from your descendants.' Adam will say, 'O Allah! How many are the people of the Fire?' Allah replys, 'From every one thousand, take out nine hundred and ninety-nine.' At that time children will become hairy headed, every pregnant female will miscarry, and one will see mankind as drunken, yet they will not be drunken, but dreadful will be the Wrath of Allah. The people became afraid and their faces changed with fear. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, 'Nine hundred and ninety-nine will be from Ya'juj and Ma'juj and one person will be from you.'**" (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim, and this is the wording of Al-Bukhari).
