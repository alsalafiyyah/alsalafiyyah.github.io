Question: 

Would you please explain the Signs of the Hour and tell us how we can protect ourselves from them and what we should do if we witness these Fitnahs (Trials)? May Allah reward you with the best!  

Answer:

There are many Signs of the Hour, and some of them are included in the answer that the Prophet (peace be upon him) gave to Jibril (Gabriel, peace be upon him) when he asked him about the Signs of the Hour: "**When a slave gives birth to her master. When the black camel herders compete in (the construction of) tall buildings.**" [^1]

The signs also include: The appearance of Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist), the descent of 'Isa ibn Maryam (Jesus son of Mary, peace be upon him) from the heavens, the rising of the sun from the west, the emergence of the Beast, the abundance of money to the extent that if someone is given a lot of money, they will not be satisfied, and the spread of Fitnah from which no Arab house will escape.

You should read the book entitled Al-Nihayah by Ibn Kathir (may Allah have mercy upon him). This book explains many of the Signs of the Hour and contains many lessons and examples. It also explains how you can protect yourself from the Fitnah.
