Question: 

Will Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist) appear, because - from what I have read - some scholars have confirmed this while others deny it? 

Answer:

Yes, Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal will appear. There are clear Sahih (authentic) and Mutawatir (Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) Hadiths that have affirmed this. Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him) has a chapter in his Sahih Book of Hadith dedicated to "References to Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal" that includes ten Hadiths about him. These Hadiths were explained by Al-Hafizh Ibn Hajar (may Allah be merciful to him) in his book: "Fath Al-Bari". You may refer to that book or any other books of Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) that elaborate on this issue.
