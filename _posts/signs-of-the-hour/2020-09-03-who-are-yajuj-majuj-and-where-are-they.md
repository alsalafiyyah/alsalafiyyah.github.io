Question: 

Who are Ya'juj and Ma'juj (Gog and Magog), which continent do they possibly live in, and are they on the earth? 

Answer:

Ya'juj and Ma'juj are from Bani Adam (human beings, descendents from Prophet Adam, peace be upon him) from the line of Yafith ibn Nuh (peace be upon him). They live in Asia, in northern China. They live on earth, like other human beings, they have great strength and boldness, and they used to spread mischief on earth. 

Allah (Exalted be He) says, "**when describing the journey of Dhul-Qarnayn to the Far East and the reforms he made during this journey: Then he followed another way, Until, when he came to the rising place of the sun, he found it rising on a people for whom We (Allâh) had provided no shelter against the sun. So (it was)! And We knew all about him (Dhul-Qarnain). Then he followed (another) way, Until, when he reached between two mountains, he found, before (near) them (those two mountains), a people who scarcely understood a word. They said: "O Dhul-Qarnain! Verily Ya’jûj and Ma’jûj (Gog and Magog) are doing great mischief in the land. Shall we then pay you a tribute in order that you might erect a barrier between us and them?" He said: "That (wealth, authority and power) in which my Lord had established me is better (than your tribute). So help me with strength (of men), I will erect between you and them a barrier. "Give me pieces (blocks) of iron;" then, when he had filled up the gap between the two mountain-cliffs, he said: "Blow;" then when he had made them (red as) fire, he said: "Bring me molten copper to pour over them." So they [Ya’jûj and Ma’jûj (Gog and Magog)] could not scale it or dig through it. (Dhul-Qarnain) said: "This is a mercy from my Lord, but when the Promise of my Lord comes, He shall level it down to the ground. And the Promise of my Lord is ever true." And on that Day [i.e. the Day Ya’jûj and Ma’jûj (Gog and Magog) will come out], We shall leave them to surge like waves on one another; and the Trumpet will be blown, and We shall collect them (the creatures) all together.**" [al-Kahf: 89-99]
