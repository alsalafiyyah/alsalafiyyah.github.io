Question: 

Will Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist) be sent to everyone, alive or dead, or just to those who will be living at the time of his emergence? Will dead people be resurrected during his time? 

Answer:

Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal will appear to those living only. Dead people will not be resurrected except on the Day of Judgment. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**After that, surely, you will die. Then (again), surely, you will be resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.**" [al-Mu'minun: 15-16]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
