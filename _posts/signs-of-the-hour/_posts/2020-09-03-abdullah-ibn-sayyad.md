Question: 

Who is Ibn Sa'id? Is he Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist)? Why did the Prophet (peace be upon him) not mention whether it was him or not? 

Answer:

Abdullah ibn Sayyad appeared in the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him), and some Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) thought he was Al-Dajjal. The Prophet (peace be upon him) himself thought the same, until he knew afterwards that it was not him, rather he was a soothsayer. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him: "**I have something hidden for you. Ibn Sayyad said, “It is Al-Dukh.” (And he was really hiding for him Surah Al-Dukhan). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to him, “Be off! You can never go beyond your position.”**" [^1] Meaning: You are one of the fellowmen of the soothsayers who have allies of Satans to tell them a lot of the unseen things which they stealthily hear. 

Moreover, they used to mix truth with lies as in the Sahih (sound) Hadith related by Al-Bukhari and others, that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**The angels descend in the clouds and mention this or that matter decreed in the Heaven. The devils listen stealthily to such a matter, come down to inspire the soothsayers with it, and the latter would add to it one-hundred lies of their own.**" [^2]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
