Question: 

Is Al-Jassasah, which is mentioned in the Hadith reported by Tamim Al-Dary, the same creature as the one which will be of the Greater Signs of the Hour (Doomsday)? What will this creature do when it appears? Will it cause harm or not? 

Answer:

Al-Jassasah mentioned in the Hadith reported by Tamim Al-Dary (may Allah be pleased with him) is different from the creature which Allah will bring out from the earth at the end of time as a Greater Sign of the Hour (Doomsday).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
