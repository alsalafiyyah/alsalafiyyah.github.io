Question: 

Will Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist) appear, because - from what I have read - some scholars have confirmed this while others deny it? 

Answer:

Yes, Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal will appear. There are clear Sahih (authentic) and Mutawatir (Hadith reported by a significant number of narrators throughout the chain of narration, whose agreement upon a lie is impossible) Hadiths that have affirmed this. Imam Al-Bukhari (may Allah be merciful to him) has a chapter in his Sahih Book of Hadith dedicated to "References to Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal" that includes ten Hadiths about him. These Hadiths were explained by Al-Hafizh Ibn Hajar (may Allah be merciful to him) in his book: "Fath Al-Bari". You may refer to that book or any other books of Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) that elaborate on this issue.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
