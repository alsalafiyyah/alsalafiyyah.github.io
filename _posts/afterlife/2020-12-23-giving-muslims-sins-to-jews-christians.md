Question:

Burdening the Jews and Christians with the Muslims' sins on the Day of Resurrection contradicts Allah's saying: "**...nor will you be requited anything except that which you used to do.**" [YaSin: 54] And other similar Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) in the Qur'an. I hope that Your Eminence will remove this confusion? 

Answer:

In regard to the Prophet saying: "**He will forgive them for Muslims and put them on the Jews and the Christians,**" [^1] the narrator of this report doubted the exact wording of the Hadith, thus his report may not be taken as a base for judgment in the presence of doubt. Moreover, it contradicts the evident meaning from the Qur'an. However, if it was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him), he only said what was true and it is obligatory to accept it in agreement with the other evidence. In that case, it would be understood that it refers to the Jews and Christians who caused Muslims to commit sins, thus these sins are forgiven for Muslims and the burden is placed upon the seducers. Allah says: "**They may bear their own burdens in full on the Day of Resurrection, and also of the burdens of those whom they misled without knowledge.**" [Al-Nahl: 25] 

The Prophet also says: "**Those who invite others to follow the misguidance that they follow, will carry the same sins as those committed by those who follow them, without their own sins being reduced at all.**" [^2]

There are also other Hadiths in this regard.
