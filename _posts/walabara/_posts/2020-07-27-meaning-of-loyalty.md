Question: 
 
What is the meaning of Allah’s Saying: "Take not as friends the people who incurred the Wrath of Allâh (i.e. the Jews)." [al-Mumtahanah: 13] What is the meaning of aligning or allying oneself with them? Does it involve visiting, speaking and joking with them?

Answer:

Allah (Exalted be He) forbids believers to establish with the Jews and other disbelievers an alliance of friendship, love, solidarity and support. Moreover, believers are forbidden to take disbelievers as retinue of advisors, consultants or helpers even if they are not Muharibs (those at war with Muslims). Allah (Exalted be He) says, "You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people). For such He has written Faith in their hearts, and strengthened them with Rûh (proofs, light and true guidance) from Himself." [al-Mujadilah: 22]

He also says, "O you who believe! Take not as (your) Bitânah (advisors, consultants, protectors, helpers, friends) those outside your religion (pagans, Jews, Christians, and hypocrites) since they will not fail to do their best to corrupt you. They desire to harm you severely. Hatred has already appeared from their mouths, but what their breasts conceal is far worse. Indeed We have made plain to you the Ayât (proofs, evidence, verses) if you understand." [Aal Imran: 118] 

"Lo! You are the ones who love them but they love you not But if you remain patient and become Al-Muttaqûn [the pious - See V.2:2], not the least harm will their cunning do to you. Surely, Allâh surrounds all that they do." [Aal Imran: 120] 

In addition, there are many similar texts from the Qur’an and Sunnah that promote the same meaning. However, Allah (Exalted be He) does not forbid the believers from repaying kindness shown by non-combatant disbelievers with kindness, or exchange of lawful benefits with them, such as purchase and sale, or to accept from them presents or gifts. Allah (Exalted be He) says, "Allâh does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allâh loves those who deal with equity. It is only as regards those who fought against you on account of religion, and have driven you out of your homes, and helped to drive you out, that Allâh forbids you to befriend them. And whosoever will befriend them, then such are the Zâlimûn (wrong-doers - those who disobey Allâh)." [al-Mumtahanah: 8-9]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
