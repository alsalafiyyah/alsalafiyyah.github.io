Question: 
 
Is it permissible for a Muslim to be generous to non-Muslim companions by offering them foods and drinks that are prohibited by Islam upon Muslims? What is the ruling on this especially when a Muslim visits his non-Muslim companion?

Answer:

Islam is the religion of tolerance and ease; it is also the religion of justice. Generosity to companions is one of the morals of Islam. But if the companion is a non-Muslim, then the ruling differs according to the intention of the Muslim who offers, and what is being offered. If the intention is legal; coming closer to him to invite him to Islam and save him from Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance, then this is considered a noble aim. One of the established rules of Shari'ah is that the means have the same ruling as the end result. If the end is obligatory, then means is obligatory, and if the end is prohibited, the means will also be prohibited. If there is no legal intention behind being generous to that person and there is no harm of abandoning him upon one's religion, soul, family, and money, then being generous to him is not permissible. 

If one may be harmed due to not being generous to them, then it is permissible. However, offering them illegal foods and drinks prohibited by Allah as swine flesh and wine is not permissible. Otherwise, this will be an obedience to them in defiance to Allah and giving priority to their desires over the rights of Allah. A Muslim should adhere to His religion and not help others in evil and transgression. Being adherent to one's religion in non-Muslim countries has great effects. By doing so, one will be a Da`i (caller to Islam) by his sayings and deeds.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
