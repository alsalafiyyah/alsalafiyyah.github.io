Question: 
 
What is the ruling on a person who worships Allah Alone and associates nothing with Him in worship, yet he is living with communities of disbelievers and is unable to openly declare his Islam, or clarify its objectives, or leave the non-Muslim country where he lives?

Answer:

 If the situation is as you have mentioned, then this person is excused for being incapable of leaving the non-Muslim land and fleeing with his religion to a place where he can publicly profess Islam, propagate it and clarify its objectives to others. May Allah pardon his incapacity. However, he should exploit the opportunity of living in a non-Muslim land in calling non-Muslims to embrace Islam secretly. It may be that Allah arranges for him those who will both respond to his call and be a means of support to him. He should also try his best to migrate from this non-Muslim land to a Muslim land whenever the opportunity presents itself. This helps in increasing the number of Muslims and he will be able to share practicing the rites of Islam with them.
 
On the other hand, Muslims who are able to migrate to Muslim countries, yet prefer to live suppressed or servile in non-believers’ countries at the compromise of their religion are doing wrong to themselves, to their religion and to Muslims on the whole. They are threatened to end up abiding in Hellfire.What an evil destination!

Allah (Exalted be He) says: "Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): "In what (condition) were you?" They reply: "We were weak and oppressed on the earth." They (angels) say: "Was not the earth of Allâh spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?" Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women and children who cannot devise a plan, nor are they able to direct their way. These are they whom Allâh is likely to forgive them, and Allâh is Ever Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving." [An-Nisa: 97-99]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
