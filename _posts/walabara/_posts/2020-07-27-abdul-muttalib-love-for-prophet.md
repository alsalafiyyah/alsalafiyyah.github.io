Question: 

I watched the TV series "The Grandfather of the Leader of Mankind," which made me love `Abdul-Muttalib and Abu Talib. Allah knows that I loved them out of my love for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Am I sinful due to my love for them, knowing that they died without accepting Islam? Would you please advise me, may Allah cover you with His protection. Peace and blessings be upon our leader Muhammad, may Allah grant you peace.
 
Answer:

The care of 'Abdul-Muttalib, and protection of Abu Talib given to the Prophet (peace be upon him), and the latter's support for him should not lead us to love them, because 'Abdul-Muttalib died while maintaining the religion of Jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance) which is Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). As for Abu Talib, he knew the truth but did not act according to it and he refused to pronounce the Shahadah (Testimony of Faith) while dying when the Prophet (peace be upon him) asked him to. Rather, he said: "I am following the religion of `Abdul-Muttalib." Consequently, we should detest and resent them for the sake of Allah.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
