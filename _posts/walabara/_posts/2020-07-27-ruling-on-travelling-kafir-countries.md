Question: 

We know a religious brother who wants to travel to Italy to visit his brothers there in order to maintain family ties. Is maintaining family ties considered a legal reason for this person to travel to the land of the disbelievers

Answer:

If the person who wants to travel to the land of the disbelievers needs to travel, for example, to maintain ties of kinship which is obligatory, can avoid temptation and guard his Islamic obligations, it is permissible for him to travel. However, he must not stay there for long.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
