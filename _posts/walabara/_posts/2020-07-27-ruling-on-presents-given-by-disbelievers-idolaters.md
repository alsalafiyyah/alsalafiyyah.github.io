Question: 
 
In India some festivals related to the Hindus (worshippers of idols) are celebrated. As I am their neighbor they present me with some desserts like those Muslims served in the blessed 'Eid-ul-Fitr (the Festival of Breaking the Fast). There are different opinions regarding accepting these desserts; some people consider eating them permissible on the grounds that they are not meat. Others view that eating these desserts is Haram (prohibited) on the grounds that they were dedicated to other than All√¢h. It should be noted that these desserts are not homemade; rather they are purchased from the stores. Please inform me of what should be done.

Answer:

It is not permissible to accept or make use of the gifts given by disbelievers to Muslims on their festivals and religious occasions. Accepting such gifts is a sort of approval of their falsehood and being satisfied with what they do. Consequently, a Muslim should be mindful and be careful when it comes to matters related to his faith.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
