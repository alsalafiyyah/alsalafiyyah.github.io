Question: 
 
Is it permissible for a Muslim to employ a non-Muslim as a servant or driver? What if this employer has no religion?

Answer:

It is not permissible for a Muslim to employ a Kafir (non-Muslim) as a servant, driver, or anything else in the Arabian Peninsula. This is because the Messenger (peace be upon him) commanded that the Mushriks (those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) should be driven out of the Arabian Peninsula. Thus, if you do so you will be bringing in people that Allah ordered to be kept away; you will trust those that Allah judged as treacherous. Hence, employing non-Muslims involves many evils.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
