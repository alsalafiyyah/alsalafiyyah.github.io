Question: 
 
Is it permissible to visit relatives who love disbelievers?

Answer:

It is permissible to visit such relatives on condition that the person visiting them advises and instructs them to stop their love of disbelievers. To do so, one is encouraged to make clear to them the meaning of the principle of Al-Wala' wal-Bara' (loyalty to Muslims and disassociation from non-Muslims for Allah's Sake) so that they might be aware of what is lawful and what is prohibited thereof and that they might give up this evil deed. Moreover, for the sake of complying with the principle of enjoining good and forbidding wrong, which is stressed even more in the case of relatives as it will be a means of both keeping good ties with relatives and propagation of the Shari`ah, such a visit might even be obligatory. However, it is impermissible to visit such relatives in the case that such a condition is not met.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
