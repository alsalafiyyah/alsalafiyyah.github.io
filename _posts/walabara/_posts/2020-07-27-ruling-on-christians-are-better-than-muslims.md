Question: 
 
It is common among us to say "Nowadays the Christians are better than Muslims in dealing with others."
 
Answer:

It is not permissible to prefer non-Muslims to Muslims, either in terms of how they deal with others or in anything else. Allah has cursed the hypocrites who say to the disbelievers "...they are better guided as regards the way than the believers (Muslims)." [An-Nisa: 51] Even if some Muslims happen not to be honest in dealing with others, we cannot judge that all Muslims are the same.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
