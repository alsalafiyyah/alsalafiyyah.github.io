Question: 

Is listening to a Christian radio station forbidden, although the listener believes in Islam, Allah, and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and no one can shake his belief no matter what evidence they have. But listening to this radio station is nothing but curiosity and a desire to learn about their beliefs?
 
Answer:

It is not permissible to listen to a Christian radio station that calls for embracing the Christian faith in order to avoid Fitnah (temptation), except for the scholars who want to dispel their misconceptions, refute their propaganda, and warn Muslims against their evils.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
