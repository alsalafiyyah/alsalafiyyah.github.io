Question: 

There is no doubt regarding the Kufr (disbelief) of those who worship graves, pious people, including the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and others, or those who supplicate anyone other than Allah, the Exalted. What should my attitude be toward he who holds this creed, defends it, and admits the name of the group who holds the 'Aqidah (creed) previously mentioned? Should I greet him? If he greets me, should I reply, or should I renounce him, oppose him, and show people how dangerous he is? Would you please tell me what to do in this respect?

Answer:

You should call those whom you mentioned to the path of Allah, show them their manifest error, and advise them, may Allah guide them to the right path. If they respond positively, all praise be to Allah. If not, keep away from them, do not initiate the greeting, do not return it, or even answer them. Allah, Glorified be He, states, "Indeed there has been an excellent example for you in Ibrâhîm (Abraham) and those with him, when they said to their people: "Verily, we are free from you and whatever you worship besides Allâh: we have rejected you, and there has started between us and you hostility and hatred for ever until you believe in Allâh Alone" [al-Mumtahanah: 4]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
