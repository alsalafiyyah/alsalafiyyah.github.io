Question: 

What is the ruling on participating in the feasts of the Christians? Please advise us. May Allah reward you.
 
Answer:

It is not permissible to participate in the feasts of the Christians or any of the Kuffar (disbelievers) since this falls under cooperation in sin and transgression, approval to Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), and declaring loyalty to the Kuffar. Allah (Exalted be He) says describing the slaves of the Most Gracious (Allah): "**And those who do not bear witness to falsehood**" [al-Furqan: 72] which means that they do not attend Munkar whether it is a feast of Kuffar or anything else.
