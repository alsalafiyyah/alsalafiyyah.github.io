Question: 

A Muslim man has a car and lives in a village in the desert. There is a Christian doctor in the village and this Muslim man drives him every month to any place the doctor wants. The doctor does not ride with anyone but him. Can we consider this a friendship relationship, and is it permissible in Islam?

Answer:

Offering benefits and doing good to non-hostile unbelievers are from the worldly matters which are permissible, as long as a Muslim denies their beliefs and religion. Allah (Exalted be He) states: "**Allâh does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allâh loves those who deal with equity.**" [al-Mumtahanah: 8]
