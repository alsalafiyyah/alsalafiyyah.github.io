Question: 

These people deal with each other so kindly and friendly that they invite each other to their respective rooms to eat take-away meals, drinks, fruits or the like. I expect to be invited by any of them, Christians or atheist. May I accept their invitation, and thus have to reciprocate the invitation, or refuse? In fact, I do my best in calling them to Islam verbally or by example In shaâ€™a-Allah (if Allah wills). However, I fear that they may consider it arrogance and Islamic unsociability on my part not to accept their invitation, which might lead them to be disinclined to understand Islam. What is your opinion?

Answer:

You may invite them to your room and accept their invitation so long as you call them to Allah as explained in <a href="/ruling-on-living-with-kafirs/">the answer to the first question</a>.
