Question: 
 
What is the ideal way to deal with a Dhimmy (protected non-Muslim living under Islamic rule)? Should they be dealt with in the normal way?

Answer:

The ideal way for Muslims when dealing with a Dhimmy is to honor the agreement made with them according to the Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) and Hadith that command the fulfillment of agreements and dealing kindly and justly with them. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "Allâh does not forbid you to deal justly and kindly with those who fought not against you on account of religion nor drove you out of your homes. Verily, Allâh loves those who deal with equity." [al-Mumtahanah: 8] 

Generally, we should talk politely to and treat kindly with them, except in what the Shari'ah (Islamic law) prohibits, such as initiating greetings with them, or allowing them to marry Muslim women or inherit from a Muslim, and other similar matters. For more details on the subject, please refer to "Ahkam Ahl Al-Dhimmah" by Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyyah (may Allah be merciful to him) and what the scholars have said on this matter.
