### Question: 

What is the ruling on a benevolent disbeliever who does good towards Muslims such as building a Masjid (mosque) for them and giving money to poor Muslims. Shall he enter Paradise for his benevolence?

### Answer:

If a disbeliever does good for the Muslims, he is rewarded for this in this life; however, it is not a reason for him to enter Paradise. Entering Paradise is a reward for Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/ monotheism) and abiding by the Shari'ah (Islamic law).
