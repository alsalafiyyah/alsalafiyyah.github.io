Question: 

I am a government employee. My direct supervisor is Christian. What is the ruling on using phrases such as: "May Allah bless you", "May Allah honor you" or "May Allah protect you" to my Christian boss? Do these phrases go against Allah's statement in Surah Al-Tawbah: 113, "**It is not (proper) for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allâh’s Forgiveness for the Mushrikûn (polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh), even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to them that they are the dwellers of the Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief).**" ?

Answer:

You should not use such phrases with a Kafir (non-Muslim), but rather ask Allah to guide him to Islam. If he does you a favor, you may show thanks by saying "I am grateful to you" or the like. Regarding this Ayah, it addresses one who dies in a state of Kufr.
