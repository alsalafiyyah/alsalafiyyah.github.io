Question: 
 
Is it permissible to spend the night in the house of a Mushrik (the one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity) from among those who glorify shrines and sacrifice for other than Allah?

Answer:

It is not permissible to spend the night in the house of a Mushrik from among those who glorify shrines and sacrifice for anyone other than Allah. This is because he may call the Muslim to his Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and disbelief. However, one is allowed to do so if he is obliged to do so or if there is a benefit from spending the night there as calling him to Allah and guiding him to the truth in order that Allah may guide him to accept the truth.
