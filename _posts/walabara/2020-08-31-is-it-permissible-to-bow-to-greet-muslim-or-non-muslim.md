Question: 

We joined a karate club in America. The coach said: "You should bow when your opponent bows to you". We refused and explained that this is against our religion. He agreed but said: "You should only gesture by your heads, for an opponent initiates a greeting by bowing and you should greet him back". What is your opinion on this?

Answer:

It's not permissible to bow to greet a Muslim or a non-Muslim whether by the upper part of the body or with the head, because bowing is a religious act of 'Ibadah (worship) and 'Ibadah should be devoted to Allah Alone.
