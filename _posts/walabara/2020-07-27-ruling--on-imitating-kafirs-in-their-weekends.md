Question: 
 
What is the ruling on a school owner who appoints its weekends on both Saturdays and Sundays, and allows studying on both Thursdays and Fridays? Is it permissible for him to lead Muslims in Salah (Prayer) or not?

Answer:

It is not permissible to allocate either Saturdays or Sundays or both of them as weekends, since this implies imitating the Jews and Christians. For, the Jews have their weekends on Saturdays, whereas Christians have their weekends on Sundays, out of a sense of honoring them (these two days). 

It was authentically reported from Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him and his father) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I was asked to fight people with the sword closely before the Day of Judgment so that Allah Alone is worshipped. My sustenance has been made under the shadow of my spear; and whoever disobeys me shall be humiliated. He who copies any people is one of them. Related by Ahmad, Abu Ya'la, Al-Tabarany, Ibn Abu Shaybah, and 'Abd ibn Humayd. Shaykh-ul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah stated: Its Sanad (chain of narrators) is good. 

This Hadith implies the prohibition of imitating other than the Muslim community. Accordingly, it is forbidden in general to imitate the Jews and Christians in anything, including having weekends on Saturdays, like the Jews, or on Sundays, like Christians. There is nothing wrong in this person's leading Muslims in Salah, provided he has no impediment other than what has been mentioned. Yet he should be advised and warned against imitating Allah's enemies regarding their holidays and suchlike.
