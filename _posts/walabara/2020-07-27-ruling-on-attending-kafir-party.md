Question: 
 
My inquiry is about the wedding of my brother-in-law who is a Magus. Should we travel with him to conclude his marriage contract with his fianc√©e? Should we help him with money for example, knowing that my husband is the only Muslim in his family, while I am Muslim by birth? What are the legal rulings that regulate dealing with non-Muslim people, like the members of my husband's family?
 
Answer:

It is not permissible for a Muslim to have Wala' (loyalty) to unbelievers, represented in this particular situation by attending the celebration of your brother-in-law's marriage and traveling with him for this purpose. The wedding celebrations and the like include some rites associated with Kufr (disbelief).
