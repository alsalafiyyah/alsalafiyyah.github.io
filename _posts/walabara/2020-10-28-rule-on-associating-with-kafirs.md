Question: 

What is the association with Kafirs (disbelievers) that is prohibited by Shari`ah (Islamic Law)?

Answer: 

Loving the Kafirs, helping them in falsehood and considering them friends are major sins and means leading to Kufr (disbelief) in Allah. If a person helps them against the Muslims, this is association which is considered one of the forms of apostasy, according to Allah's (Glorified be He) Saying: "**O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliyâ’ (friends, protectors, helpers), they are but Auliyâ’ of each other. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliyâ’, then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allâh guides not those people who are the Zâlimûn (polytheists and wrong-doers and unjust).**" [Al-Maidah: 51]

"**You (O Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم) will not find any people who believe in Allâh and the Last Day, making friendship with those who oppose Allâh and His Messenger (Muhammad صلى الله عليه وسلم), even though they were their fathers or their sons or their brothers or their kindred (people).**" [Al-Mujadilah: 22]

He (Glorified and Exalted be He) also says: "**O you who believe! Take not as Auliyâ’ (protectors and helpers) those who take your religion as a mockery and fun from among those who received the Scripture (Jews and Christians) before you, and nor from among the disbelievers; and fear Allâh if you indeed are true believers.**" [Al-Maidah: 57]

May Allah grant us success.
