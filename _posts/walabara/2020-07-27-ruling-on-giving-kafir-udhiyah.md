Question: 

If my neighbor is non-Muslim, but he never annoys me with regard to my ‘Ibadah (worship). Is it permissible to give him a part of Ud-hiyah (sacrificial animal offered by non-pilgrims) or ‘Aqiqah (sacrifice for a newborn)? Respected Shaykh, we hope you will clarify this issue for us.

Answer:

It is permissible to give a non-Muslim from the meat of an Ud-hiyah or ‘Aqiqah, as a way of showing kindness to neighbors and discharging neighborhood duties.
