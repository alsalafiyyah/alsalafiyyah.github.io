Question: 
 
There are non-Muslims working with us in our company, who are Sikhs, Hindus, and Christians. What are our obligations to each other and how should we treat them, without becoming friends?

Answer:

You should invite them to Islam, enjoin Ma'ruf (that which is judged as good, beneficial, or fitting by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) on them, and forbid them from Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of). You should return kindness with kindness, and gently attract them to Islam with good deeds. You should do this while disliking their Kufr (disbelief) and misguidance.
