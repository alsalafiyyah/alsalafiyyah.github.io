### Question: 

Is it permissible to have one temple for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam?

### Answer:

It is not permissible to have one place of worship that gathers the three religions. This is because this place will not be established on piety, but will be established on Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and worshipping people other than Allah. There is no sound religion except Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And whoever seeks a religion other than Isl√¢m, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers.**" [Aal Imran: 85]
