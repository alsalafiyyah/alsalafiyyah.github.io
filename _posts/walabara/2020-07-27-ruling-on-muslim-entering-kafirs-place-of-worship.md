Question: 
 
Is it permissible for a Muslim to enter a church to know of their prayers or listen to a lecture?

Answer:

A Muslim is not allowed to enter the places of worship of disbelievers as this leads to increasing their number. It was reported by Al-Bayhaqy with a sound chain of transmitters on the authority of 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: "**...And do not enter upon Mushrikun (those who associate others with Allah in worship) in their churches or temples as the wrath of Allah descends upon them.**" But if there is a legal benefit underlying the act or you do so for the sake of inviting them to Allah, there will be no blame on you.
