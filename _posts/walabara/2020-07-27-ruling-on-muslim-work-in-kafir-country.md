Question: 
 
Is it permissible for Muslims to work in non-Muslim countries and can we relate this to the work that Prophet Yusuf (Joseph, peace be upon him) was doing?

Answer:

It is permissible for Muslims to work in non-Muslim countries if they feel safe in themselves from Fitnah (temptation) in their Din (religion), they are able to guard themselves with their knowledge, they want to reform and benefit others in addition to themselves, and they do not support falsehood; and Prophet Yusuf (peace be upon him) was one of those people. Otherwise, it is not permissible.
