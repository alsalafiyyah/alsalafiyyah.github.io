Question: 

In our company, Muslim employees work together with Christian and Hindu employees. Some employees collect a sum of money from employees in order to hold a farewell party when one of the foreign employees is leaving. The party is composed of serving a meal plus a gift to the guest. Does a Muslim's participation with their money and selves in this kind of celebrations affect the Muslim's 'Aqidah (creed) in any way? Could you kindly advise? May Allah reward you!
 
Answer:

Muslims' participation with non-Muslims in collecting a sum of money to hold a party to see off non-Muslims is a kind of respect and honor to them which is not permissible for a Muslim to do or even take part in. It is obligatory to call non-Muslims to Islam, illustrate its beauty and draw it near to them perhaps Allah will guide them.
