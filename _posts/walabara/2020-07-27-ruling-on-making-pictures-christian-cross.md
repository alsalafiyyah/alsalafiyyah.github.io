### Question: 
 
Images of crosses have become openly visible. Muslims are so neglectful of this issue that we now see it on TV channels, commercial magazine, etc.
1. What is the ruling on making pictures of crosses in general?
2. What is the ruling on publishing pictures of crosses in magazines, ads, etc.?
3. We see the pictures of the cross in some Islamic magazines in order to warn people against Christians and reveal their missionary plans, what is the ruling on this?
4. What is the ruling on taking photos of their religious rites?

### Answer:

Firstly, it is not permissible to take photos of crosses or any other symbol of disbelief, or to publish them in magazines and ads. The only exception is when someone intends to warn Muslims against glorifying and respecting them while ensuring that the publisher attaches a statement illustrating its falsehood.

Secondly, it is not permissible to take photos of non-Muslim rituals or circulate them among Muslims because they contain acts of disbelief in Allah and His Messenger and contradict Islam. This may also attract people to them, especially those of weak faith. Furthermore, this removes the Muslim's repugnancy of disbelief; thus it must be avoided.
