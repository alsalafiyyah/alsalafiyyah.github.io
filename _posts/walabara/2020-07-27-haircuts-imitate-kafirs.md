Question: 

What is the ruling on haircuts worn by some young men nowadays, imitating the disbeliever Michael Jackson? What if it is done not intending to imitate him?
 
Answer:

The Shari'ah (Islamic Law) has prohibited imitating disbelievers in their clothes, customs or morals, for this is a means of being influenced by them, inclining to and loving them, which is prohibited. Therefore, it is not permissible to wear haircuts like that of Michael even if it is not intended to imitate him.
