Question: 
 
In the area where we work, there are some Arab Christians who sometimes invite us to visit them. Is it permissible for us to visit them and invite them to visit us?

Answer:

If your intention of visiting is to advise and invite them to Islam, then inviting to Islam is a noble aim. Therefore, your invitation and visit at their houses is a means to realize this noble objective; the means are judged the same as their objectives.
