Question: 

There is a brother in Islam whom I like very much, more than other brothers. Since having met him, I visit him more than the others. Is this considered love for the sake of Allah? I cooperate with him in distributing books and tapes. May Allah reward you!

Answer:

loving and hating for the Sake of Allah is the most trustworthy handhold in faith. However, loving for Allah's Sake is not limited to a particular person; rather, it should be for all believers.
