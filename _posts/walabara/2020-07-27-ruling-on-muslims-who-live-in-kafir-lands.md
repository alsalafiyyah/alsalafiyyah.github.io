Question: 

I found in one of your Fatwas regarding travel to the land of disbelievers a Hadith of the Messenger (peace be upon him) stating: "**I am not responsible for any Muslim who stays among polytheists.**"[^1] My question is: Is the Prophet not being responsible for those Muslims mean that he, (peace be upon him), will not intercede with Allah for the Muslims who live in the lands of the disbelievers with no legitimate excuse?

Answer:

Whoever resides in non-Muslim countries with no legal reason and does not emigrate to Muslim countries to practice his religion though able to do so, is exposing themselves to punishment and wrath of Allah as mentioned in the Holy Qur'an and Prophetic Hadith.
