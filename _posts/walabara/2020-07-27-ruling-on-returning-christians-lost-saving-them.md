### Question: 

Is it permissible for a Muslim to return lost property he finds which belongs to a disbeliever? Is it permissible for a Muslim to save a drowning disbeliever? Is it considered love of disbelievers to do so? May Allah reward you!

### Answer:

First: It is obligatory on a Muslim to return the lost property of a disbeliever who is under Islamic protection if he finds it.

Second: It is permissible for a Muslim to save a drowning non-Harby (non-fighting against Muslims). It is part of dealing kindly with disbelievers to attempt to incline their hearts towards Islam. However, it does not fall under prohibited love of disbelievers.
