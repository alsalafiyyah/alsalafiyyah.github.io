### Question:
We studied something about the theory of Evolution and all that relates to creation as this forms part of our educational curriculum. The more I read on this subject, the more I become convinced that Allah is the Only One Who created this universe and all that it contains. Nevertheless, I was greatly astonished to come across a book written by a Muslim author approving the theory of Evolution and supporting it by the Qur'an! Moreover, one of my Muslim teachers asked me: "Since Islam forbids a man to marry to his sister; how could brothers and sisters amongst the offspring of Adam and Eve get married to each other?

### Answer:
The theory of Evolution which is renowned as the theory of Darwin contradicts the Qur'an, Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and Ijma` (consensus of scholars). There are thus proofs from the Qur'an and authentic Sunnah stating that Allah (Exalted be He) created Adam from soil then created Eve from Adam.

Regarding the fact that Adam (peace be upon him) married his sons to his daughters, this is something that he did according to the law that Allah commanded him to follow which we do not have any right to argue with. Anyway, as far the Shari'ah (Islamic law) that was sent to Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) is concerned; Allah makes it Haram (prohibited) for a man to marry his sister along with other well-established categories of women that a man is not allowed to marry. Besides, since Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says, **"To each among you, We have prescribed a law and a clear way."** [al-Ma'idah (5):48] while mentioning the laws of Tawrah (Torah), Injil (Gospel), and Qur'an; the same applies for Adam (peace be upon him) i.e. he had a specific law that he followed.
