### Question: 
There are some who claim that man was once an ape and then evolved. Is this correct, and is there any evidence to support this?

### Answer: 
This statement is false (not correct); the evidence on that is that Allah has clarified in the Qur’an the stages of Adam’s creation, saying (what means): "Verily, the likeness of ‘Isâ (Jesus) before Allâh is the likeness of Adam. He created him from dust..." [Aal 'Imran (3):59]

Then that dust was wetted until it became sticky clay, clinging to the hands; Allah the Exalted says (what means): "And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth)." [Al-Mu'minun(23):12]

Allah also says (what means): "Verily, We created them of a sticky clay." [Al-Saffat(37):11] 

Then it turned into altered black mud; Allah the Exalted states (what means): "And indeed, We created man from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud." [al-Hijr (15):26]

And when it dried, it turned into clay like that of pottery; Allah the Exalted states (what means): "He created man (Adam) from sounding clay like the clay of pottery." [al-Rahman (55):14]

Allah then fashioned Adam into the form that He willed and then breathed into him the soul which He created for him, Allah the Exalted says (what means): "And (remember) when your Lord said to the angels: "I am going to create a man (Adam) from dried (sounding) clay of altered mud. So, when I have fashioned him completely and breathed into him (Adam) the soul which I created for him, then fall (you) down prostrating yourselves unto him." [Sad (38):71-72]

These are the stages of Adam’s creation according to the Qur’an. As for the stages of creating Adam’s offspring, Allah the Exalted says (what means): "And indeed We created man (Adam) out of an extract of clay (water and earth). Thereafter We made him (the offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops of the male and female sexual discharge and lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the woman). Then We made the Nutfah into a clot (a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then We made out of that little lump of flesh bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh, and then We brought it forth as another creation. So Blessed is Allâh, the Best of creators." [al-Mu’minun (23):12-14] 

As for Adam’s wife, Hawwa’ (Eve), Allah the Exalted has clarified that He created her from Adam, saying (what means): "O mankind! Be dutiful to your Lord, Who created you from a single person (Adam), and from him (Adam) He created his wife [Hawwâ’ (Eve)], and from them both He created many men and women." [an-Nisa’ (4):1]
