### Question: 
Is it permissible for a Muslim to vote in municipal elections for a communist or someone who mocks religion and is loyal to nationality, not religion?

### Answer: 
It is impermissible for a Muslim to elect a communist, a person who mocks religion or one whose loyalty is to nationality, not religion, to represent them in municipal councils. Electing them means that they have agreed to them as representatives, and helped them take a position they might use to spread corruption and appoint someone who shares the same corrupted ideology. They might also use this position in doing harm to those who disagree with them and deprive them of their rights by force of their position and mutual interests between them and their colleagues in other municipalities. This also encourages them with their false creeds and makes them do what they like.
