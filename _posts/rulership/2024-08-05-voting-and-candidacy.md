### Question: 
Is it permissible to vote or nominate for elections, given the fact that our country is not ruled by the law revealed by Allah?

### Answer: 
It is not permissible for a Muslim to nominate himself hoping to be a part of a system disagreeing with the Islamic revealed law. Similarly, it is not permissible for a Muslim to vote for anyone who will work in that government unless the one who nominates himself or those who vote for him hope that their participation may enable them to change the system to act upon Shari`ah and are using this as a means to overcome the system of government. Moreover, a person who nominates himself should not accept any position after being elected except if it is in conformity with the Islamic Shari'ah.
