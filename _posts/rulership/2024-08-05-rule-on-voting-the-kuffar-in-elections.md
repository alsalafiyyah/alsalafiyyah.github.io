### Question: 
Is it permissible for a Muslim to vote in elections? If yes, is it permissible for them to vote for Kuffar (disbelievers)?

### Answer: 
It is impermissible for Muslims to vote for Kuffar, as this may lead to exalt their status and boost their power and authority, resulting in them having ascendancy over Muslims. 

Allah (Glorified be He) says: **"And never will All√¢h grant to the disbelievers a way (to triumph) over the believers."** [An-Nisa: 141].
