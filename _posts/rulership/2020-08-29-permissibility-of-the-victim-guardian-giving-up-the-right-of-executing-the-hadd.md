Question: 

In the current Shawwal 20, two students in the first grade in the preparatory school committed homosexuality with a third student, after bullying him and preventing him from seeking help. The case is pending for investigation. My question is: Is it permissible for the guardian of the victim to forgo the two perpetrators and give up the complaint, or is this one of Allah's Rights?

Answer:

The guardian of the victim is not permitted to forgo, for executing the punishment is Allah's right, and the ruler is the one responsible for the execution.
