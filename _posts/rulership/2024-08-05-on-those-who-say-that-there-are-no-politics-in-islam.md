### Question: 
What is your view on those who say that there are no politics in Islam and no Islam in politics?

### Answer: 
The Shari'ah (Islamic law) has prescribed the correct policies between Muslim countries and other countries in times of peace and war. It has also prescribed the correct and successful policies that Muslim rulers must adopt when dealing with or governing Muslims all over the Islamic Ummah (nation) with respect to their spiritual and worldly life.

As for evil politics that are based on corruption, delusion, lies, violating covenants, deceit and breaking promises, this was not prescribed by Shari'ah, and whoever looks into the texts of The Book, the Prophetic Sunnah and the biography of the Prophet (peace be upon him) will find that they are abundant in truthful and just policies observed with allies and enemies.
