Question: 

If a divorced man commits Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage), should he be stoned to death or considered unmarried? Is it permissible to carry out Hadd (ordained punishment for violating Allah’s Law) upon oneself, such as cutting one's hand after performing Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from stealing?

Answer:

First, this matter should be referred to the ruler and the court, given that one of the greatest objectives of Islam is urging the concealment and performing Tawbah in privacy.

Second, it is impermissible to cut one's own hand to apply the Hadd of stealing or to kill oneself if there is a reason to do it. A person should perform Tawbah instead, seek Allah's forgiveness, regret what they had done and determine not to do it again. They should also return the stolen money to its owners, while concealing themselves and not admitting that they had stolen. If they cannot find the money owners, they can give the money as a Sadaqah (voluntary charity) on their behalf.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
