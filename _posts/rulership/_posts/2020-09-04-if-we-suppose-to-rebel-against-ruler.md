Question: If we suppose that a certain group has a lawful excuse to rebel against a ruler, does this justify killing the assistants of this ruler and all those who work for their government, such as the police, the security forces, etc.? 

Answer:

I informed you before that it is not permissible to rebel against the ruler, except under two conditions:

1. The first: Blatant Kufr (disbelief) for which they have a proof from Allah.
2. The second: The power to depose the ruler without an evil worse than that of the ruler resulting. In the absence of these conditions, it is not permissible.
