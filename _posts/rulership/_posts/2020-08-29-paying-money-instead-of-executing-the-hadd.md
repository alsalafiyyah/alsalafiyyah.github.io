Question: 

What is the ruling on substituting a prescribed penalty proven by texts of the Qur'an and the Sunnah with a monetary fine? For example, instead of cutting off the hand of a thief, he is fined a sum of money and instead of stoning an adulterer and flogging a fornicator, they are fined a specific sum of money.

Answer:

It is not permissible to substitute the Hudud (ordained punishments for violating Allah’s Law) that Allah decreed with monetary fines; because the Hadud are Tawqifi (bound by a religious text and not amenable to personal opinion) and it is not permissible to change them.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
