Question: 

In the current Shawwal 20, two students in the first grade in the preparatory school committed homosexuality with a third student, after bullying him and preventing him from seeking help. The case is pending for investigation. My question is: Is it permissible for the guardian of the victim to forgo the two perpetrators and give up the complaint, or is this one of Allah's Rights?

Answer:

The guardian of the victim is not permitted to forgo, for executing the punishment is Allah's right, and the ruler is the one responsible for the execution.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
