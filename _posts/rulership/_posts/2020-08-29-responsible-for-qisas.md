Question: 

We live in a non-Islamic country where a Muslim man may be killed for reasons such as being angry with another or due to pride or just because he is wealthy or so; is it permissible for us to kill murderers in retaliation since the ruling states, 'an eye for an eye and a soul for a soul'? It should be noted that if we do so, we will be sent to jail.

Answer:

It is not permissible to resort to Qisas (just retaliation) unless the crime is legally confirmed through the legal court. Only the ruler should bring the retaliation not the individuals because they are not entitled to do so; because this would result in much harm and chaos.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
