### Question: 
What is meant by Al-Siyasah Al-Shar'iyyah?

### Answer:
Al-Siyasah Al-Shar'iyyah is policy that is based on the Qur'an and Sunnah, by the ruler administering justice and the subjects giving loyalty and obedience. It is explained by the Words of Allah (Exalted be He): **"Verily, Allâh commands that you should render back the trusts to those to whom they are due; and that when you judge between men, you judge with justice."** [an-Nisa': 58] up to His Saying: **"O you who believe! Obey Allâh and obey the Messenger (Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)), and those of you (Muslims) who are in authority."** [an-Nisa': 59].
