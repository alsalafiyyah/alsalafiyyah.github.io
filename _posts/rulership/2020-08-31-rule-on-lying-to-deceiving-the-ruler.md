Question: 

The governmental system does not allow government employees to open a shop of their own. Is it permissible to open a shop under the name of another person, who is unemployed by the government, and run this shop with a power of attorney that gives me the right to all the business transactions and to bear its profit and loss? Is this permissible?

Answer:

If that is the status quo (in your country), then you are not allowed to do that, because it involves lying to and deceiving the authorities, and using trickery to violate the regulations which they set to maintain the flow of governmental work, which was entrusted to you to serve the nation, and guard public interest against self-interest. In the case you have mentioned, self-love or the instinct or desire to promote oneâ€™s own well-being will dominate and this makes one prefer his personal interest; thus he will work harder and exert his utmost effort for its success at the expense of his work in public interest, without perceiving this.
