Question:

Since its establishment, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has applied the Shari'ah of Allah and ruled according to His Legislations. What is our duty towards this responsibility? 

Answer:

It is obligatory upon citizens to acknowledge the services provided to them by the state and thank it for that. They should help the state to reform its affairs through good words and good manners and not through attacking and publicizing the negative aspects of the state in newspapers and on the Minbar (pulpit). Reformation should be done through offering advice, writing to officials to draw their attention to the problems of which they are not aware until they are solved and until goodness and welfare prevail, blessings settle and people are safe from afflictions. There is no way to achieve that unless advice is exchanged. It is the state's responsibility to correct shortcomings, carry out all the actions that please Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and eliminate all that which Allah has prohibited and which contradicts the Shari'ah. This can be carried out through cooperation with scholars, employees, righteous officials, and Committee for the Propagation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.
