Question: 

Some people believe that they have the right to break the laws that have been made by the ruler, such as the traffic laws, customs, passports, etc., as they consider them as having no basis in the Shari‘ah. What is your opinion? May Allah preserve you! 

Answer:

This is Batil (null and void) and Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect). I have already said that it is not permissible to rebel against rulers or to change matters with your hand. In fact, it is obligatory to hear and obey in matters that do not involve Munkar, but rather are organized by Muslims charged with authority to serve the benefit of Muslims. So it is obligatory to abide by these laws and hear and obey in these matter, because this comes under the Ma‘ruf that benefits the Muslims. As for the matters that are Munkar, such as taxes that those in authority deem to be permissible, this should be discussed with those in authority by way of advising and calling to obey Allah, and guidance to the good. Not by using the hand to strike this, shed the blood of that, and punish people without inexcusable evidence or supporting proof. One must be authorized by the ruler, and act according to the given commands. Otherwise, it will be sufficient to give advice and guidance, except with regard to those one is responsible for, such as a man’s children, wives, and the like.
