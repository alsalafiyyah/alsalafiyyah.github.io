Question: 

Is it permissible to join an activity that requires shaving one's beard, being unable to perform some of the prescribed Salahs (Prayers) at their due times, or obeying military orders to do what Allah has forbidden?

Answer:

It is not permissible for a Muslim to indulge in something that entails all these forbidden acts or even some of them; for this leads to disobedience to Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him). However, if someone is under coercion, and is forced to do these things by an authoritative power, they will not be blamed. We hope that Allah will guide them to the way out and relief them, as He (Exalted be He) says, "**And whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.**" [al-Talaq: 2-3]

He (Exalted be He) also says, "**...and whosoever fears Allâh and keeps his duty to Him, He will make his matter easy for him.**" [al-Talaq: 4]
