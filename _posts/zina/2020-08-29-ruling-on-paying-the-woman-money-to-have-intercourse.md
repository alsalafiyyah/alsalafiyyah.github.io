Question: 
I am an unmarried man; I fear committing sins. What is the ruling if I give a woman a sum of money to kiss and have sexual intercourse with her considering this money to be a Mahr (mandatory gift to a bride from her groom)

Answer:

First, you should protect yourself and stay away from the avenues leading to Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage) and hasten to get married if you can; otherwise, you should observe Sawm (Fast). It was authentically reported that the Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, "**O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, for marriage would help him lower his gaze and keep his chastity and whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to fast, for fasting would diminish his sexual power.**" (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim) [^1]

Second, the said money would not be considered Mahr; rather it is ill-gotten property,and is Haram (prohibited). This is Zina. You should repent to Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) and regret what you did. You should also determine faithfully not to repeat this again. May Allah guide and save you.
