Question: 

What is the ruling on committing Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage)? Is it permissible for those working in Europe and are away from their spouses for a long time to commit Zina? Some of them can not bring their families to Europe for different reasons.

Answer:

A Muslim is prohibited to commit Zina, even if he is away from his wife for one or two years or more. He has to travel to his wife to satisfy his desire through lawful means and to achieve chastity. If he is unable, for some reason or another, to travel to or bring her to the country where he works, he may lawfully marry a woman, a Muslim or from the free and chaste People of the Book, from this country. If he can not do so, he may fast as fasting weakens the desire or prevents him from fulfilling it through forbidden means.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
