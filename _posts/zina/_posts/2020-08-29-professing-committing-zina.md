Question: 

In our school, some students talk publicly about Zina (adultery) and admit to having committed it. What should I do in this case? Am I considered sinful?

Answer:

You should rebuke them, advise them and tell them that Zina is one of the gravest crimes that endanger the family, and one of the grave sins whose perpetrator is threatened with Hellfire and deserves Hadd (ordained punishment for violating Allahâ€™s Law). They should hide their sins and not disgrace themselves in public, according to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), "**All people among my Ummah (i.e. Muslims) will be forgiven except for people committing sins and not being ashamed to announce it in public.**" [^1]

This also leads to spreading sin and corruption among the Mu'minun (believers), whereas Allah says, "**Verily, those who like that (the crime of) illegal sexual intercourse should be propagated among those who believe, they will have a painful torment in this world and in the Hereafter.**" [al-Nur: 19]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
