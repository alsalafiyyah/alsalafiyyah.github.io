Question: 

Repeated lustful thoughts may preoccupy a person's mind thus driving them to discharge Maniy (sperm) as a result of being sexually aroused. Does this fall under the prohibited masturbation? Will the person be considered a masturbator if they seek sexual pleasure through constantly occupying their mind with sexual excitement? Please inform us of the Islamic opinion in this regard. May Allah reward you!

Answer:

A person is not to be blamed if lustful thoughts happen to strike their mind unintentionally. It is related in an authentic Hadith reported on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**Truly Allah overlooks for my people their heart whisperings.**" 

In another narration, he (peace be upon him) said, "**Truly Allah overlooks what my people say to themselves, as long as they do not act upon it or say it (out loud).**"

On the other hand, the person who discharges Maniy as a result of their mind being preoccupied with lustful thoughts must take Ghusl (ritual bath following major ritual impurity), as they are considered in a state of major ritual impurity. It is, however, neither permissible nor befitting of a Muslim to have their mind repeatedly preoccupied with the thought of sexual excitement.

Such an evil habit is also incongruous with the true meaning of manhood. A Muslim has to give it up and occupy themselves with what benefits them in terms of their religion and their worldly life. In addition to inviting evil consequences, unlawful sexual excitement is harmful to a person's mental health and may incur many harmful effects.

Such an evil habit becomes all the more abhorrent if practiced by a married person, who getting accustomed and falling victim to it, may threaten instability of their married life, which is supposed to be dominated by tranquility and mercy between the couple.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
