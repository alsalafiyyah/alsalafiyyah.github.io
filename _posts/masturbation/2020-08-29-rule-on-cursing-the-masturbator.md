Question: 

Is a masturbator included among the seven types of people whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) cursed in one of his Hadiths? I feel ashamed of having practiced this evil habit. What should I do? I have asked Allah to forgive me, but I fear to be among those cursed by the Prophet (peace be upon him).

Answer:

Masturbation, known as "the secret habit", or any habit of this sort is prohibited. As far as we know, there is no evidence that a masturbator is cursed. In addition, the Hadith you are referring to is classified as Da`if (weak).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
