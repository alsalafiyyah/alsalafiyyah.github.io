Question: 

I am a fifty year old man who does not have enough money to marry. However, I have married three times before but none of my marriages succeeded. I requested help from the Minister of the Interior and he responded generously to me, may Allah reward him with the best. After the decree has been sent to the public hospital of Najran, a committee decided that I should masturbate and bring some of my Maniy (spermatic fluid), is doing so considered Halal (lawful)? Please tell me how I can solve such a problem. May Allah reward you with the best.

Answer:

Masturbation is permissible under necessity as in the case you have mentioned in the question. However, masturbation is Haram when it is done abusively or only for attaining sexual pleasure.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
