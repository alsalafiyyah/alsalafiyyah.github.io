Question: 

I would like to know the Islamic ruling on intentional rubbing of the prostate gland to discharge Maniy (sperm), as I always do this. Can this practice fall under the prohibited masturbation? Bear in mind that I am incapable of getting married due to my financial and health conditions.

Answer:

Masturbation is prohibited regardless of the adopted method, as it entails drawing unlawful sexual pleasure out of wedlock. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors;**" [al-Mu'minun: 5-7]

The prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**O you young men! Those among you who can afford a wife should marry, for it helps to lower the eyes and protects the virtue of the private parts; but those who cannot (afford it) should fast, for it is a means of controlling sexual desire.**" [^1]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) gave young men two options; either to marry or to fast if they cannot afford marriage. There is no other way, which denotes the prohibition of resorting to masturbation.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
