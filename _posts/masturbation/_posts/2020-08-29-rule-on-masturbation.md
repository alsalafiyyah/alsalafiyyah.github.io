Question: 

A person observes obligatory acts of worship such as Salah (Prayer) and Sawm (fast) etc. However, he practices masturbation. What is the ruling on this in Islam?

Answer:

The preponderant of scholars' views about masturbation commonly referred to as "Secret Habit" is that it is an unlawful sexual activity. The majority of religious scholars held this view based on the generality of the saying of Allah (Exalted be He), "**And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors;**" [al-Mu'minun: 5-7]

Allah (Exalted be He) praises those who fulfill their sexual desire with their wives or slave girls and considers those who fulfill their sexual desire elsewhere as transgressors who leave what Allah made lawful for them to commit unlawful sexual activities including masturbation. It has many harmful effects and bad consequences such as exhaustion of power and impotence. The Islamic Shari`ah (law) protects man against anything that may cause harm to his religion, body, mind, money or honor.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
