Question: 

I have neglected offering the Fajr (Dawn) Prayer at its due time for five times because of practicing masturbation, which brings about a feeling of laziness after which I remain in bed until the time of Prayer is over. When I wake up, I ask for Allah's Forgiveness and perform the other Obligatory Daily Prayers at their fixed times. I fear that I may fall under the category of men described in the following Hadith in which the Messenger (peace be upon him) said: "**A man would be a believer in the evening and a disbeliever in the morning or he would be a believer in the morning and a disbeliever in the evening.**" [^1] 

Also, I feel that the Jinn (creatures created from fire) possess me while performing Salah, for I obviously shiver when reciting the Qur'an (Remembrance of Allah) with Khushu' (the heart being submissively attuned to the act of worship). Please advise; may Allah reward you!


Answer:

You must perform the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers regularly in their fixed times in congregation. Also, you must stop practicing masturbation, because it is Haram (prohibited) and causes diseases. You will be cured In shaâ€™a-Allah (if Allah wills) if you perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah) and offer the Five Prayers regularly in their fixed times.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
