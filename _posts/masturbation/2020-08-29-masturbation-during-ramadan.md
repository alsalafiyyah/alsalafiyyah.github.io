### Question: 
I am a young man in the habit of masturbating. I masturbated on one of the days of Ramadan. What should I do to expiate for my sin on that day?

### Answer:
Masturbation is prohibited, as it involves drawing sexual pleasure in a way that Allah has made unlawful. If it is practiced during Ramadan, the sin is even graver. You must perform Tawbah (repentance to Allah) from this sin, resolve not to return to it, and make up for that day in Ramadan.
