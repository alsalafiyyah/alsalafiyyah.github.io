Question:

We would like your Eminence to advise us regarding using Saudi Payments Network (SPAN). For example, a person buys items from a store that cost 150 riyals, he presents the card to the seller who passes it through a machine and the required money is immediately deducted from the customer's account and is added to the seller's account before the customer leaves the store.

Answer:

If the case is as mentioned, there is no problem in using this card as long as the buyer has a sufficient balance to cover the purchase.
