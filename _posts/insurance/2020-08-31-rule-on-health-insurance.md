Question: 

Someone has a dispensary and used to conclude contracts with some companies to treat their employees for a specific amount of money per year. The employees of the contracting companies have the choice to go every now and then without a minimum or maximum limit for their visits. Is this contract Islamically valid? I hope Your Eminence will clarify the issue for me. May Allah grant us all success and guide your steps for He is All-Hearing, All-Answering.

Answer:

This is known as Health Insurance and it is one form of commercial insurance which is Muharram (prohibited) according to the decree of the Council of Senior Scholars. [^1]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
