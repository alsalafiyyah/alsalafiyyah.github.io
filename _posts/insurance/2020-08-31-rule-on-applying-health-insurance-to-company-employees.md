Question: 

I am working in a certain company which makes contracts with some hospitals to supply medical insurance for the staff of this company since it pays one million riyals, for example, to the hospital annually. Those hospitals have to treat the patients of the company staff for certain diseases and injuries according to what has been agreed upon in the terms of the contract. Is it permissible for us as employees to be treated in such hospitals according to the terms of this contract or is it a form of gambling?

Answer:

The commercial insurance - which includes the Health insurance- is Muharram (prohibited) in all its forms as it involves using people's money unjustly. It also implies fraudulence, ignorance and gambling. Hence, it is obligatory upon every Muslim not to take part in such systems or even to use them if he is working in any company that applies this to its employees. Moreover, he has to treat himself from his personal money and to keep away from Haram practices.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
