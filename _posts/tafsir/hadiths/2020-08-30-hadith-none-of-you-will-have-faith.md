Question: 

Would you please explain the meaning of the following Hadith:  "**None of you will have faith until his desire is in accordance with what I have brought.**" [^1] May Allah bless, protect, and enlighten you.

Answer:

This Hadith means that the Iman (faith) of a person is never complete unless his desires and inclinations are in conformity with what the Prophet (peace be upon him) came with. Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) said that obeying the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) maintains and preserves good works. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**But if you obey Allâh and His Messenger (peace be upon him), He will not decrease anything in reward for your deeds.**" [al-Hujurat: 14]

When Allah and His Messenger have decreed a matter, a believer should not have any choice. They should rather submit and surrender. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**It is not for a believer, man or woman, when Allâh and His Messenger have decreed a matter that they should have any option in their decision.**" [al-Ahzab: 36]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
