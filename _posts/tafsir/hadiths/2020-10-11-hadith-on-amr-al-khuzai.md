Question:

Is it reported in any Hadith that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw, during his Salah (Prayer), 'Amr ibn Luhay turning from side to side in Hellfire, because he was the one who brought the worship of statues into the Ka'bah or into the Arabian Peninsula? Is this Hadith considered to be Sahih (a Hadith that has been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish), and if so, can it be used as evidence that it is not hateful to perform Salah in front of electric, oil, or gas heaters? Please advise us of the Truth and may Allah (Exalted be He) make you and us from those who listen to good words and follow the good in them! O Allah! Make us from the people of understanding who apply the Book and the Sunnah to themselves and their families. Truly, You are the All-Hearing, the Knowing, the One Who is Close and responds to Du'a (supplications). 

Answer: 

It is related in "Sahih Al-Bukhari" on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "**I saw 'Amr ibn 'Amir Al-Khuza'i dragging his intestines in the Fire; he was the first one to release animals (for the idols).**" [^1]

It is also reported in "Sahih Al-Bukhari" on the authority of `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, "**I saw Hell destroying itself and I saw 'Amr dragging his intestines, and he was the first one to release animals (for the idols).**" [^2] 

There is no evidence in the Hadith that suggests the validity of facing fire or anything such as electric and oil heaters. Similarly, they do not convey that the Prophet saw the man while performing Salah.
