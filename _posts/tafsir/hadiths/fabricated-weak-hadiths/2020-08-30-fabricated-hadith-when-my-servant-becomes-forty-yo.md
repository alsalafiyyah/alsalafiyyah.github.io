Question: 

A friend of mine told me a Hadith and I could not find its Takhrij (referencing), as we have a lack of references. The Hadith states:  "**When my servant becomes forty years old, I will guard them against three afflictions: madness, leprosy and vitiligo. When they become fifty years old, I will give them an easy reckoning. When they become sixty years old, I will make them love returning to Me. When they become seventy years old, angels will love them. When they become eighty years old, their good deeds will be written and their bad deeds will be abolished. When they become ninety years old, the angels will call them Allah's prisoners on earth, so they are forgiven their past and future sins, and they intercede for their families. When they reach senility, the same good deeds they used to do when they were healthy will be written for them, and the evil deeds will not be written for them.**" Please advise concerning whether this Hadith is Sahih (authentic) or not.

Answer:

The mentioned Hadith is extremely Da'if (weak). It is even ranked by some Hafidh (memorizers of Hadiths) as Maudu' (fabricated Hadith), such as in the book entitled "Al-La'ali' Al-Masnu`ah fi Al-Ahadith Al-Mawdu'ah" by Al-Suyuti (vol. 1, p. 138). 

Thus, it is not permissible to attribute it to the Prophet (peace be upon him).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
