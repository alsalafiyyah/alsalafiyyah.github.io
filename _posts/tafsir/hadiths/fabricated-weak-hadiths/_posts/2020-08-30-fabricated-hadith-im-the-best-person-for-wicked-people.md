Question: 

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "I am the best person for the wicked people of my Ummah (nation based on one creed)." The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them) said: "You are the best for their wicked ones, what about their good people?" The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Their good people will enter Jannah (Paradise) with their deeds and their wicked ones will enter Jannah with my intercession." Is this a Hadith Sahih (authentic)?

Answer:

The mentioned Hadith was not authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) because Yahya ibn Bastam was the only narrator of this Hadith and he was a weak narrator. 

Ibn Hibban said: "It is not permissible to relate from him because he is one of the callers to [the Qadariyyah (a deviant sect that claims Allah has no power over His Creation and humans are independent of Him)](/qadariyyah]." 

This has been mentioned in the book of "Al-Jarh wal-Ta'dil". Also, Jumay' ibn Thawb is one of the narrators of this Hadith whom the author of "Lisan Al-Mizan" has described as Matruk (a narrator whose Hadith transmission was discarded due to unreliability). Al-Bukhari, Al-Daraqutni, and others said that his narrations were rejected.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
