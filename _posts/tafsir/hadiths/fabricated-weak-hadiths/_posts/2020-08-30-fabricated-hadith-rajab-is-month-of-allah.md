Question: 

What is the opinion of Hadith scholars on the following statement: "**Rajab is the Month of Allah, Sha'ban is my month, and Ramadan is the month of my Ummah (nation based on one creed)**"? 

Is the following Hadith authentic: "**O Allah, to You do I complain of my weakness, helplessness, and disregard of people towards me...**"?

Answer:

Firstly, the statement: "**Rajab is the Month of Allah, Sha'ban is my month, and Ramadan is the month of my Ummah**" is a Hadith Mawdu' (fabricated Hadith). Its Sanad (chain of narrators) includes Abu Bakr ibn Al-Hasan Al-Naqqash who is accused of fabrication, and Al-Kisa'i who is unknown and his name was mentioned in Al-La'ali' fy Al-Mawdu`at [reference book about fabricated Hadiths].

Secondly, concerning the Hadith: "**O Allah, to You do I complain of my weakness, my helplessness, and disregard of people towards me. O Most Merciful of the merciful. You are the Lord of the oppressed, and You are my Lord. To whom do You entrust me? Is it to a stranger who would frown on me? Or is it to an enemy to whom You have given mastery over me? If You are not angry with me, then I do not care. But Your Protection is the more all-embracing for me. I seek refuge in the Light of Your Face whereby all darkness has shone, and the affairs of worldly life and the hereafter are set right, lest You should send down upon me Your Anger or Your Wrath should befall me. Yours Alone is the right to blame until You are Content, and there is neither power nor might except with You.**" This Hadith is ranked as Da'if (weak; a Hadith that fails to reach the status of good Hadith) due to a weakness in its Sanad.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
