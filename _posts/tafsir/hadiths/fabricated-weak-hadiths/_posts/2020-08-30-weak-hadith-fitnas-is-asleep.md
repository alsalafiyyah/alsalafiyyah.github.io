Question: 

What is the ruling on the authenticity of these two Hadiths:  "**Fitnah (sedition or turmoil) is asleep (dormant). May the Curse of Allah be upon the one who wakes it up (stirs it up).**"

And: "**Stay away from Khadra' Al-Diman (i.e. Verdure growing in manure).' It was asked, 'O Messenger of Allah, what is Khadra' Al-Diman?' He (peace be upon him) replied, 'A beautiful woman of a bad origin.'**"

Answer:

The Hadith that reads: "**Fitnah is asleep. May the Curse of Allah be upon the one who wakes it up**" is mentioned by Al-'Ajluni, the author of Kashf Al-Khafa' who mentioned that Al-Najm said: "Al-Rafi'i related it in His book Al-Amali from Anas." It was also related by Al-Suyuty in Al-Jami' Al-Saghir who ranked it as weak.

The Hadith that reads: "Stay away from Khadra' Al-Diman" is related by Al-Daraqutny, Al-'Askari, Ibn 'Adi and Al-Quda'i and others. Al-Daraqutny said: "There is no authentic narration of it."

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
