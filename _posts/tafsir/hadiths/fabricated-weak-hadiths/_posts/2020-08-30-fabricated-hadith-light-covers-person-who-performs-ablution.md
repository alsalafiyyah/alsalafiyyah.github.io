Question: 

A friend of mine told me the following: "**Light covers the person who performs Wudu' (ablution).**" Is this a Hadith or a common saying? I hear some people who talk during Wudu'.

Answer:

This saying is groundless and not attributed to the Prophet (peace be upon him).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
