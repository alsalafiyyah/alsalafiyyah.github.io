Question: 

Is the following a true Hadith: "**The best among you is the one whose first child is a girl**" ?

Answer:

This saying is groundless and not attributed to the Prophet (peace be upon him). There are similar wordings mentioned by Al-Hafidh Al-Suyuti in his book "Al-Ahadith Al-Mawdu'ah (Fabricated Hadiths)."

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
