Question: 

Is the following a Sahih (authentic) Hadith? What is its significance? 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) narrated on the authority of his father that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: 

"**A time will come when most people have the faces of human beings and the hearts of ravenous wolves. They are bloodthirsty and do not watch over their actions. When they make a pledge with you, they equivocate; when they talk, they lie; when they are entrusted, they betray; when you leave them, they backbite you. Their young are reckless, their youth are highwaymen and their aged people are corrupt. They do not enjoin good and do not forbid evil. Intermixing with them entails humiliation and asking them entails poverty. The meek among them is looked upon as a seducer and the seducer is looked upon as meek. The Sunnah in their eyes is Bid'ah (innovation in religion) and the Bid`ah is Sunnah. The person who enjoins good among them is accused and the Fasiq (someone flagrantly violating Islamic law) is honored. The Mu'min (believer) is oppressed among them. When those people do so, Allah will give other people power over them, who will kill them if they talk and will transgress against them if they keep silent. They will take hold of them through their spoils and will oppress them in judgment.**"

Answer:

This Hadith must not be attributed to the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is mentioned by Al-Hafizh Al-Suyuti in "Al-La'ali' Al-Masnu'ah fi Al-Ahadith Al-Mawdu'ah" [a reference book about fabricated Hadiths] vol. 2, p. 385.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
