Question: 

What is the meaning of the following Hadith: "**When Allah wills good for His servant, He uses him.**" ?

Answer:

It is related by Al-Tirmidhi and others on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**'When Allah wills good for His servant, He uses him.' They said, 'How does He use him?' He said, 'He guides him to do good deeds before he dies.'**" [^1]

Al-Tirmidhy commented, saying: "It is Hadith Hasan Sahih (a Hadith that stands at a higher level than a mere Hasan Hadith, but at a bit lower level than Sahih). This Hadith indicates that a person is judged according to his final deeds, and that a Muslim should adhere to obeying Allah (Exalted be He) by doing what He enjoins and refraining from what He forbids. Furthermore, he should increase his good deeds, hoping that Allah will reward him with a blessed end.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
