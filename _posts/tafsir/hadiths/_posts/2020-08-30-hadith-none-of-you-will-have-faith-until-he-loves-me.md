Question: 

Would you please explain the meaning of the following Hadith:  "**None of you will have faith until he loves me more than his father, his children, and all mankind.**" What is meant by love in this Hadith?

Answer:

The Hadith means that it is obligatory for a Muslim to give priority to obedience to Allah and His Messenger over obedience to anyone else, whether offspring, parent or any person. It also explains the importance of following the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him) in all matters. The Hadith indicates that Iman (faith) is not perfect except by achieving this.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
