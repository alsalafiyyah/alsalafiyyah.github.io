Question: 

Does the Hadith saying: "**For every flesh that is grown up from unlawful earnings, Hellfire is most entitled to it**" apply to a foundling?

Answer:

The Hadith which is mentioned in the question generally applies to eating from unlawful sources. It is a threatening Hadith that does not by any means include a foundling. This is because a foundling did not commit any sin and no one bears another's burden. Allah (Exalted be He) says, "**...and no bearer of burdens shall bear the burden of another.**" [al-An'am: 164]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
