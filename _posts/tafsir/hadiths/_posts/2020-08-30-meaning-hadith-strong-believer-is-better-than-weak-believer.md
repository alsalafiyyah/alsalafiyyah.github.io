Question: 

It is reported that "**[A strong believer is better than a weak believer](https://www.instagram.com/p/CEB9ih3DtGZ/ "A strong believer is better than a weak believer")**" Is this about physical or spiritual strength and is it the same with regard to wealth and poverty?

Answer:

The Hadith refers to the strength of faith. A believer who has strong faith is far better than a believer who has weak faith. With regard to physical strength, if it does not make the person do good deeds, it will be of no avail.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
