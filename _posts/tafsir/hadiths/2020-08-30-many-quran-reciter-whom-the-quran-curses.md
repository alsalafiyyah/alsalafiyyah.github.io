Question: 

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "**There is many a reciter of the Qur'an whom the Qur'an curses.**" I would like Your Eminence to explain the meaning of this honorable Hadith, as I conversed with a Muslim brother regarding it, and he told me that the people that are meant by the Hadith are those who read the Ayah (Qur'anic verse) warning against Riba (usury) and yet indulge in usurious dealings, or read the Ayah of showing dutifulness towards one's parents, and yet they are undutiful to them, and many other cases. Is this what the honorable Ayah suggests? Or is it applicable to those who recite the Qur'an without pondering over its meanings or Ayahs? I would like Your Eminence to elaborate on this matter.

Answer:

This is an Athar (narration from a Companion) reported from Maymun ibn Mahran, not a Hadith attributed to the Prophet (peace be upon him). It warns Muslims who recite the Qur'an against the neglect of acting according to its teachings. Some servants may recite the Qur'an and pass over its prohibitions heedlessly. For example, they read the prohibitions of Riba, injustice, and Ghibah (backbiting) and yet indulge in usurious dealings, injustice, and Ghibah, and so on.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
