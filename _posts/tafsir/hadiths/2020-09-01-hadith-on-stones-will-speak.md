### Question:
Is the Hadith that says: **"There will come a day when Muslims will gain victory over the Jews, and then a stone behind which a Jew may hide, will speak and call the believer to go and kill the Jew hiding behind it"** authentic?
 
### Answer:
It was reported that Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said: **"I heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying: 'You (i.e. Muslims) will fight against the Jews and you will gain victory over them. The stones will (betray them) saying: 'O 'Abdullah (i.e. slave of Allah)! There is a Jew hiding behind me; so kill him.'”** [^1] This Hadith was reported by Al-Bukhari. 

It was also reported on the authority of Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: **"The Jews will fight against you and you will gain victory over them, till the stone says: 'O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me; so kill him.'"** [^2] This Hadith was reported by Ahmad and Al-Tirmidhy who said that it is a Hasan, Sahih Hadith. 

Ibn 'Umar (may Allah be pleased with them both) said that he heard the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saying: **"The Antichrist will pass by this salty barren area i.e. Madinah, in a passage of a canal. Most of those who will come out to him will be women so that a man will return to his intimate wife, mother, daughter, sister or aunt to tie them up for fear that they might go out to him. Then, Allah will afflict him with Muslims who kill him and his followers and the Jews will hide behind a tree or a rock and the rock or the tree will say to the Muslim: There is a Jew behind me, come and kill him!"** [^3] This Hadith was reported by Ahmad in his Musnad. 

It was also reported by Ibn Majah on the authority of Abu Umamah Al-Bahily who said that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said this Hadith about Al-Masih-ul-Dajjal (the Antichrist).

And Allah is the Source of strength. May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions. [^4]

Ibn Hajar (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

"**What is meant by fighting the Jews is that this will happen when the Dajjal emerges and ‘Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) descends.**" [^5]

Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

**‘Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) will fight him (Dajjal), supported by the Muslims, and he will kill him at the gate of al-Ludd (Lod), which is in Palestine, near al-Quds (Jerusalem). He will kill him with his spear, as it says in the sahih (authentic) hadith, and the Muslims who are with him will kill a great number of the Jews. It says in the hadith from the Prophet (Muhammad, peace and blessings be upon him) that the Muslims will fight the Jews, and will kill them and gain power over them, and trees and rocks will call out: "O Muslim, O slave of Allah, here is a Jew; come and kill him." and ‘Isa will kill the Dajjal and put an end to him.** [^6]

Shaykhul-Islam Ibn Taymiyyah (may Allah have mercy on him) said: 

**"The Jews are in fact awaiting the dajjal (false messiah), for he is the one whom the Jews will follow. Seventy thousand of the Jews of Isfahan[^7] wearing tayalisah (a kind of head covering) will emerge with him. The Muslims will fight them with him, to the extent that trees and rocks will say: “O Muslim, here is a Jew behind me; come and kill him.”** [^8]
