Question: 

Your Eminence, concerning Takhrij (referencing) of a Hadith, Ta'dil (validating the uprightness of Hadith narrators) and Jarh (criticism of Hadith narrators), some people think that the field of Jarh and Ta`dil is completely closed or that it finished long ago. What is your opinion on this matter?  

Answer: 

No, this is not true. The fact is that Jarh, Ta'dil and investigating of Hadith still remain; and scholars should take care of it and revise Hadith in order to distinguish those which are Sahih (a Hadith that has been transmitted by people known for their uprightness and exactitude; free from eccentricity and blemish) from those which are Da'if (a Hadith that fails to reach the status of Hasan, due to a weakness in the chain of narration or one of the narrators) and tell the people about it. They should not suffice with mentioning so-and-so, but it should be traced, such as "Al-Muntaqa", "Bulugh Al-Maram", the Four Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes) and the Musnad (Hadith Compilation) of Imam Ahmad. Sanad (chain of narrators) should be carefully reviewed in order to distinguish what is Sahih from what is Da`if, so that everyone benefits. This is what should be done by a knowledge seeker who is guided by Allah (Exalted be He) to know Hadiths and their Sanad, and have fair experience of Jarh and Ta`dil. This entails great benefit for them as well as for others.
