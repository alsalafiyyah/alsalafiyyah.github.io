Question:

What are the Hadith Qudsy? Why they are called so? 

Answer: 

The term Hadith Qudsy refers to Revelations from Allah in the Prophet’s words. Such Revelations were sent to the Prophet through the angel Jibril (Gabriel, peace be upon him) or by direct inspiration in wakefulness or sleep. They are given that name, deriving from the word “Al-Quds” (sanctitude, holiness, sacredness), for the quality of being pure and holy, as they are ascribed to Allah (Exalted be He), the Pure and Holy, Free from imperfection or blemish.
