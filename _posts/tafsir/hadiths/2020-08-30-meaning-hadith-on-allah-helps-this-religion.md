Question: 

What is the meaning of the following Hadith:  "**Verily, Allah helps this religion (Islam) even through a wicked person.**" What is its meaning?

Answer:

This Hadith is recorded in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim). The wording of Al-Bukhari is on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) who said: "**We participated in the Battle of Hunain along with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He (peace be upon him) said about a man who claimed to be a Muslim that he was one of the dwellers of the Fire. When we were in the thick of the battle, that man fought strongly and was wounded. It was said, 'O Messenger of Allah, the man about whom you said was from among the dwellers of Fire fought strongly and died.' The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said, '(He will go) to the Fire.' Some men were on the verge of doubt (about his fate), and while in this state it was said that he was not dead but fatally wounded. When it was night he could not stand the (pain of his) wound and killed himself. The Prophet (peace be upon him) was informed of this. He (peace be upon him) said, 'Allah is the Greatest. I bear witness that I am the servant of Allah and His Messenger.' He then commanded Bilal to announce to the people, 'None but a Muslim soul would enter Paradise. Verily, Allah helps this faith even through a wicked person.'**" [^1]

The Hadith means that Allah protects Islam and makes it victorious even through a corrupt and unjust person.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
