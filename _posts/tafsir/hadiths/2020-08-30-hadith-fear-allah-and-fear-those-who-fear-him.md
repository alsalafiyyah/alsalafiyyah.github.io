Question: 

It is said that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: "**Fear Allah, and fear those who fear Him.**" Is this a Sahih (authentic) Hadith?

Answer:

The first part of the phrase which is mentioned in the question is Sahih and is narrated on the authority of Al-Nu'man that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: "**Fear Allah, and do justice to your children.**"

Regarding the second part of the statement: "**fear those who fear Him**," we do not know of any authentic basis ascribing it to the Prophet (peace be upon him).

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
