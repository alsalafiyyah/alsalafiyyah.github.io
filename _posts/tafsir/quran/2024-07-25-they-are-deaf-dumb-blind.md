### Question:
What is the explanation of the verse : **"They are deaf, dumb, and blind, so they return not"** (Al-Baqarah 2:18) ?

### Answer:
These are three qualities that Allaah Almighty described the hypocrites with – deaf, they do not listen to or hear the truth; dumb, they do not speak the truth; blind, they do not see what the truth is nor do they see by the truth. And because their senses are thus blocked from knowledge, they will not return from their wandering and from their hypocrisy.
