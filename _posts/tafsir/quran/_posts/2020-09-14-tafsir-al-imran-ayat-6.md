Question:

What is the Tafsir (explanation/exegesis) of the Ayah (Quranic Verse): "**He it is Who shapes you in the wombs as He wills. Lâ ilâha illa Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He), the All-Mighty, the All-Wise.**" [Aal Imran, 3:6]?

Answer: 

(In the preceding Ayahs) Allah (Exalted be He) describes Himself as being the One God, with no peer or partner, the Ever-Living Who never dies and the One Who sustains and protects all His creatures who cannot have any existence and their affairs cannot prosper and become upright without Allah’s Disposition, whereas Allah stands All-Rich, absolutely free of want, having no need of any of them. Allah is also the All-Knowing of everything, for nothing whatsoever on the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Him. (In the mentioned Ayah) He (Exalted be He) gives evidence for this by declaring that He alone creates people in the wombs of their mothers as He wills and according to the shape and state that He wants; males or females, handsome or ugly, wretched or happy. There is no deity but He, the Possessor of Glory and the absolutely perfect overruling Power. 

He also has the Perfect Wisdom in all that He legislates, creates, judges and predestines, as His creation of 'Isa (Jesus, peace be upon him) and His Will that his mother should conceive him without a father as a sign to mankind testifying to the absolute perfection of Allah’s Knowledge, Might and extensive Wisdom, just as He created Adam from dust and said unto him: "Be!" so he was according to what Allah willed. Therefore, these creatures have no right to be worshipped beside Allah, for worship is the exclusive Right of Allah, the Lord of the worlds, Who has no partner. There is no deity but He, the Omnipotent, Who cannot be defeated and nothing whatsoever escapes Him. He is the All-Wise in His disposing of affairs, in His creation and in His legislation. 

This also refutes the allegations of the Christians who allege that 'Isa is the son of Allah, because Allah is He who fashioned him in the womb of his mother Maryam. Therefore, how can he be Allah’s son or a deity with him! Glorified and High is Allah above the great falsehood that they say!
