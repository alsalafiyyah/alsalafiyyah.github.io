Question: 

Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) says: "**And most of them believe not in Allâh except that they attribute partners unto Him [i.e. they are Mushrikûn i.e. polytheists. See Verse 6: 121].**" [Yusuf: 106] What is the Tafsir (explanation/exegesis of the meanings of the Qur'an) of this Ayah (Qur'anic verse)? What does Shirk mean here?

Answer: 

Its meaning is explained by many scholars, such as Ibn 'Abbas and others. What it means is that when the polytheists are asked who created the heavens and earth, and who created them, they say Allah, yet despite this they worship idols and statues like Al-Lat, Al-'Uzzah and others, they seek help from them, and they make vows and offer sacrifices to them. This Iman (Faith/belief) of theirs is Tawhid-ul-Rububiyyah (Oneness of Allah's Lordship), but it is invalidated and corrupted by their Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and does not avail them anything. Abu Jahl and his like believed that Allah was their Creator and Provider, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, but this did not avail them anything, because they associated others with Allah by worshipping idols and statues. This is the meaning of the Ayah according to the scholars.
