Question : 

What is the ruling on celebrating the Mawlid (the Prophet’s birthday) in Rabi‘ Al-Awwal as a tribute to the Prophet (peace be upon him)? 

Answer:

Paying tribute to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and respecting him should be expressed by belief in all that was revealed to him from Allah; following his Shari‘ah (Islamic law) in beliefs, words, deeds and manners; and by shunning Bid‘ah (innovation in religion). Among the newly-invented practices introduced into the religion is celebrating the Mawlid.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
