Question: 

Is it permissible to congratulate non-Muslims on the occasion of the new Gregorian year, the new Hijri (lunar) year, and the Mawlid (the Prophet’s birthday)?
 
Answer:

It is not permissible to offer congratulations on such occasions, because it is not Mashru‘ (Islamically lawful) to celebrate them.
