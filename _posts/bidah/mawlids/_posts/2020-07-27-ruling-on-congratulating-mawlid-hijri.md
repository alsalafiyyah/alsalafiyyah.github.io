Question: 

Is it permissible to congratulate non-Muslims on the occasion of the new Gregorian year, the new Hijri (lunar) year, and the Mawlid (the Prophet’s birthday)?
 
Answer:

It is not permissible to offer congratulations on such occasions, because it is not Mashru‘ (Islamically lawful) to celebrate them.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
