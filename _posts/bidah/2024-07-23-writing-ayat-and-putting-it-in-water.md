### Question: 
What is the ruling on writing some Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) on a sheet of paper, putting it in water, and then drinking the water? I have seen some people doing so.

### Answer: 
Nothing is authentically reported from the Prophet ﷺ, his Rightly-Guided Caliphs, or his Sahabah (Companions, may Allah be pleased with them) in this regard. So avoiding this practice would be better. And Allah knows best.
