Question: 

We would like you to explain the meaning and types of Bid'ah (innovation in religion) in detail for us.

Answer:

Bid'ah is an act of worship that was not legislated by Allah such as celebrating the birth of the Prophet (peace be upon him), Isra' (Night Journey), and Mi'raj (Ascension to Heaven) and the raising of the Mu'adhin's (caller to Prayer) voice in offering peace and blessings upon the Prophet (peace be upon him) after pronouncing Adhan (call to prayer) and the like. A group of scholars have compiled books that point out Bid'ah and its types as:

1. Al-Sunan wa Al-Mubtada'at (Sunan and rejected innovations in religion) by Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad 'Abdul-Salam Al-Hawamdy.
2. Al-Ibda' fi Madar Al-Ibtida' (The masterpiece about the harms of innovation in religion) by Shaykh 'Ali Mahfuzh.

Both scholars are Egyptian. There were two other books written a long time ago. They are Bida' wa Al-Nahi 'Anha (Bid'ahs and the commands that prohibits them) by Imam Muhammad ibn Waddah and Al-'Itisam by Al-Shatiby.
