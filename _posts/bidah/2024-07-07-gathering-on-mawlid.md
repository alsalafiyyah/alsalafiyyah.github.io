### Question: 
Is it permissible to gather on the 12th of Rabi‘ul-Awwal to commemorate the Mawlid (the Prophet’s birthday)?

### Answer: 
Celebrating the Mawlid is an act of bid‘ah (deviant innovation). The Prophet ﷺ neither celebrated it nor ordered that it be celebrated. The Sahabah (Companions of the Prophetﷺ), who were the keenest to honor and follow the Messenger ﷺ and his Sunnah, did not celebrate it either. Indeed, all goodness lies in following the very way and guidance of the Prophet ﷺ, for he ﷺ said: **"Anyone who introduces anything into this matter of ours (Islam) that is not part of it will have it rejected."**
