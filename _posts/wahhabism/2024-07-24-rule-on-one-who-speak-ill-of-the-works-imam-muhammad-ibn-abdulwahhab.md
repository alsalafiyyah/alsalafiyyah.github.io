### Question: 
What is your opinion with regards to the one who mentions and describes the works of the Imam, the Mujaddid (Reviver of the religion), Muhammad bin ‘Abdul-Wahhab in Fiqh and ’Aqidah of having within them much repetition?

### Answer:
This individual is upon either of two conditions: either he is an ignorant one who has not studied them and does not know about them, thus it is an obligation upon him to before he makes a judgement upon something that he studies it first and has knowledge of it. So he should not make judgement of them [the books of the Imam] whilst he is ignorant.

The second affair being that he may have with him some misguidance, and these books forbid his misguidance. So it is apparent he is diseased and he hates the cure. Hence we ask Allaah for his guidance and we advise him with reading these books carefully and attentively asking questions about that which is difficult for him.
