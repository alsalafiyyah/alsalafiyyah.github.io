Question: 

What is Ghibah? What is the ruling on transgressing against the honor of people? Is it permissible to sit with a person who backbites others? 

Answer: 

Saying things about Muslims which they dislike is a major reprehensible matter in religion, falling under the prohibited backbiting. It is regarded as a major sin according to Allah's Saying: "**And spy not, neither backbite one another. Would one of you like to eat the flesh of his dead brother? You would hate it (so hate backbiting). And fear Allâh. Verily, Allâh is the One Who forgives and accepts repentance, Most Merciful.**" [Al-Hujurat: 12] 

Muslim narrated in his Sahih (authentic) Book of Hadith, on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Do you know what Ghibah (backbiting) is?" They (the Companions) said, "Allah and His Messenger know best." Thereupon, he (the Prophet) said, "(It is) to say about your brother what he dislikes." It was said to him, "O Allah's Messenger, What if my brother has what I mentioned?" He said, "If he has what you assert, you have already backbitten him, and if he has not, it will be a false accusation.**" (Related by Muslim)[^1]

Moreover, it is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) saw on the night of Mi'raj (Ascension to Heaven) people who had copper fingernails with which they scratched their faces and chests. He asked Jibril (Gabriel), "**Who are these?" He replied, "These are the people who backbite others and talk badly about their honor.**" [^2] 

Therefore, you and other Muslims should avoid sitting with those who backbite Muslims and advise them to abandon this ill deed. 

The Prophet (peace be upon him) said, "**Any of you who sees an evil action, let them change it with their hand (by taking action); if they cannot, then with their tongue (by speaking out); and if they cannot, then with their heart (by hating it and feeling that it is wrong); and that is the weakest of Iman (faith).**" [^3] 

If he does not comply with what you recommended him to do, then do not sit with him, for this is among the acts of resisting evil.
