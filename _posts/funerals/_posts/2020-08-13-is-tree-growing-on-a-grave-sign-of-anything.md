Question:

I noticed that when some people see a tree growing on a grave, they describe the inhabitant of the grave as having such and such characteristics. Is a tree growing on a grave a sign of anything?

Answer:

This is a groundless belief. Trees or herbs growing on graves are no sign of the righteousness of their occupants; this is a false assumption. Trees may grow on the graves of righteous and evil people alike, not only on the graves of the righteous. We should not be deceived by those who claim otherwise from among errant people and followers of corrupted beliefs. Allah is the One sought for help.
