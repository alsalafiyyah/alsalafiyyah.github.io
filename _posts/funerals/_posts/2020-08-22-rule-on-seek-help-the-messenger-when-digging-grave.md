Question: 

In some of our villages when digging a grave, the diggers keep on repeating a particular word, which is "Muhammad, Muhammad," until they finish digging the grave. When we asked them about the reason for repeating such word when digging the grave, they replied that they seek help from "Muhammad". Also, on burying the dead person, they say in a collective loud voice: "O Merciful! Grant us mercy when we are between Your Hands as our return is to You!" What is the ruling on such words?

Answer: 

A: First, calling upon the Messenger (peace be upon him) when digging a grave through repeating the word: "Muhammad, Muhammad," is not permissible, as it is a form of seeking help from other than Allah, which constitutes major Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship that takes the Muslim out of Islam) if the person whose help is sought is dead or absent or is a solid body; for example, an idol, a tree or a stone. Allah (Glorified be He) instructs His Servants to seek help from Him Alone in His Saying: "**You (Alone) we worship, and You (Alone) we ask for help (for each and everything).**" [al-Fatihah: 5]

It is authentically reported that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**If you seek help, seek it from Allah.**" [^2] It is obligatory for them to seek help from Allah Alone."

Second: Collective recitation of particular formulas of Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) in a loud voice when carrying the dead person during the funeral is a Bid'ah (innovation in religion). Therefore, it is not permissible to recite the statements mentioned above as this was not a practice of the Prophet (peace be upon him). It is authentically reported in the Hadith narrated by `Aishah (may Allah be pleased with her) that the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Anyone who does an action which is not in accordance with this matter of ours (Islam) will have it rejected.**" [^2]

Third: On burying the dead, it is prescribed to say: "In the Name of Allah and according to the religion of the Messenger of Allah." As for the practice of repeating the statement mentioned in the question, it is a Bid'ah.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
