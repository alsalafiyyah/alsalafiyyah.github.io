Question: 

I live in a rural area where there are Muslims and Christians. Whenever a Muslim dies, the Christians attend and follow his funeral and burial, and then offer condolences to the bereaved family. This made the mayor of the village suggests following the same practice when one of the Christians dies. He says that when a Christian dies, we should follow his funeral procession and offer condolences to the Christians. What is the ruling on this action? Please advise us, may Allah reward you.

Answer: 

It is not permissible for a Muslim to follow the funeral of a Kafir (non-Muslim) or to attend his burial, because Allah (Glorified be He) has forbidden us from supporting and befriending Kafirs. As for offering condolences to Kafirs, there is no harm in it, yet do not supplicate to Allah to forgive their deceased.

May Allah grant us success. May peace be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family and Companions!
