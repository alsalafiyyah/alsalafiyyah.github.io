Question:

Is it permissible to place a metal plate or a "sign" inscribed with some Ayahs (Qur'anic verses), the name of the deceased person, and the date of his death on the grave?

Answer:

It is not permissible to inscribe Qur'anic Ayahs or any thing else on graves. Likewise, it is not permissible to use an iron plaque, board, or otherwise. It is authentically reported on the authority of Jabir (may Allah be pleased with him) that "**the Prophet (peace be upon him) forbade plastering of graves, sitting on them, and building on them.**” (Related by Imam Muslim in his Sahih) [^1]. According to the narration reported by Al-Tirmidhy and Al-Nasa'y with (authentic) Sanad (chain of narrators), the following addition is found: "**...and [forbade] inscribing on them.**" [^2]
