Question: 

What is the ruling on bestiality?

Answer:

The ruling on bestiality and its consequences: Having sex with animals is a bad deed, transgression to bounds set by Allah and contradicts the Fitrah (natural disposition) with which a man was created. Allah (Glorified be He) does not allow people to have sex except with one's wife or slave girl. He (Exalted be He) says, "**And those who guard their chastity (i.e. private parts, from illegal sexual acts) Except from their wives or (the slaves) that their right hands possess, - for then, they are free from blame; But whoever seeks beyond that, then those are the transgressors;**" [al-Mu'minun: 5-7]

Those who commit this must repent, seek Allah's forgiveness and not to do it again in the future. If the judge has proof that a person had sex with animal, he should deter him with a punishment in order for him not to do it again.

As for the beast, it must be killed in all cases and it is not permissible to eat its meat. If the beast is his, no compensation will be paid but if it is owned by another person, the doer will pay a compensation for it to the owner. A group of scholars see that killing the beast helps in forgetting the crime and so that people will not remember it whenever they see it.
