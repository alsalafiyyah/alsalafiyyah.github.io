Question: 

It is known that Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) created the heavens and the earth in six days. This is proven in the Qur'an and the Sunnah. However, there is a Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim mentioning that the heavens, the earth, and Adam were created in seven days. How do we reconcile the Hadith recorded in Sahih Muslim and the Ayah? Please, explain. May Allah reward you.

Answer: 

It is authentically proven that Allah created the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in six days. Allah (Exalted be He) states, "**Indeed, your Lord is Allâh, Who created the heavens and the earth in Six Days, and then He rose over (Istawâ) the Throne (really in a manner that suits His Majesty).**" [Al-A'raf: 54]

He (Exalted be He) also states, "**Allâh it is He Who has created the heavens and the earth, and all that is between them in six Days. Then He rose over (Istawâ) the Throne (in a manner that suits His Majesty).**" [Al-Sajdah: 4] 

"**And indeed We created the heavens and the earth and all between them in six Days**" [Qaf: 38] etc.

The days are: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Nothing was created on Saturday for it is the seventh day and Sabt (Saturday) means interruption. The authentic reports indicate that Allah created the heavens and the earth and that is between them in six days. As for the Hadith narrated by Abu Hurayrah (may Allah be pleased with him), "**Allah created the Earth on Saturday, He created the mountains on Sunday, He created the trees on Monday, He created the things entailing labor on Tuesday, He created light on Wednesday, He spread out the animals on Thursday, and He created Adam (peace be upon him) after 'Asr (Afternoon) on Friday. It is the last of creation in the last hour of the day, between 'Asr and the night.**" [^1] 

It is recorded by Imam Ahmad, Al-Nasa'i, and Muslim according to more than one narration. It involves the stated seven days. Al-Bukhari and more than one of the Imams of Hadith said that the Hadith of Abu Hurayrah on the authority of Ka`b Al-Ahbar is not Hadith Marfu' (a Hadith narrated from the Prophet with a connected or disconnected chain of narration). However, some narrators related it to the Prophet (peace be upon him). Therefore, it is Hadith Maqtu' (a Hadith narrated from a Follower; the generation after the Prophet’s Companions) and does not contradict the Ayahs and the authentic Hadith. Accordingly, such a Hadith cannot be used as evidence. Thus, the ambiguity is resolved and both can be reconciled.
