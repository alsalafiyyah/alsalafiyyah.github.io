### Question:
Today we are witnessing a major political phenomenon that has shaken the world, namely the uprising of the Palestinian people against the Jews (the Intifada). Can you suggest something that we can say to the Muslim people in occupied Palestine?

### Answer: 
I advise them to fear Allah and to cooperate in doing good and in righteous deeds, for Allah will support those who support His cause. Allah says (interpretation of the meaning):

“**O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allah, He will help you, and make your foothold firm**” [Muhammad 47:7]

And Allah says elsewhere in His Holy Book: “**Allah has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islam). And He will surely, give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me**” [An-Noor 24:55]

I advise all of our brothers to cooperate with them and I advise the rich and those in positions of authority to extend the hand of aid to their brothers in Palestine who are striving to regain their land and achieve victory over the enemy, in sha Allah. May Allah support them with the truth and reward them with all good on behalf of the Muslims. All they have to do is to persevere in patience and constancy, and vie in such perseverance, for the promise of Allah is true and Allah will help those who help His cause. May Allah help them and grant them victory over their enemies, and may He enable the Muslims to help them and stand firm with them until Allah grants them victory over their enemy, for He is the best of supporters.
