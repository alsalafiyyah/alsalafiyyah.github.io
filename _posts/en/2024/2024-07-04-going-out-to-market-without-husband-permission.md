### Question: 
What is the ruling on a woman going out to the market without her husband's permission?

### Answer: 
If a woman wants to go out, she should inform her husband about the place she is going to and take his permission as he knows what benefits her. For the general meaning of Allah's Saying: "**And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) according to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them.**" [Al-Baqarah: 228] and "**Men are the protectors and maintainers of women, because Allâh has made one of them to excel the other.**" [An-Nisa' :34].
