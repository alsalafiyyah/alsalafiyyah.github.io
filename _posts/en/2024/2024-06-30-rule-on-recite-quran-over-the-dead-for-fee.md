### Question: 
In Morocco, most of the memorizers of the Qur'an say supplications in behalf of some people in return for a sum of money. They may also recite the Qur'an over the dead and on occasions, such as wedding ceremonies, in return for money. The number of supplications and Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) they say and recite depends on the money they receive. What advice should be given to these people? Indeed, they have gone astray and have led others astray, for on some occasions Dhikr (Remembrance of Allah) may be combined with the beating of drums and the playing of pipes. What is the ruling on those who invite them to attend their weddings?

### Answer: 
It is not permissible to recite the Qur'an in return for a payment and have this as a profession. This is because recitation of the Qur'an is an act of worship and a Qurbah (a good deed by which Allah's Pleasure is sought). Acts of worship should not be taken as means of obtaining worldly gains. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, to them We shall pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they will have no diminution therein. They are those for whom there is nothing in the Hereafter but Fire**" (Hud 11:15-16). 

In addition, it is not permissible to combine Dhikr with the sounds of Duff (a tambourine-like instrument without bells), musical instruments, and pipes since this involves disparagement of Dhikr and combing it with forbidden matters. Such habits are ascribed to the Sufis who have gone astray from the right path.
