### Question: 
What is the Islamic ruling in your opinion on saying these phrases: "Allah knows that...," "Allah forbid!" "Allah's Will," and "Allah and His Messenger know best"?

### Answer: 
There is no harm in saying "**Allah knows that...**" if the person is saying the truth. There is also no harm in saying "**Allah forbid!**" if it is said to seek the removal of something that is causing harm. Saying "**Allah's Will**" is also permissible if it is intended to attribute anything that befalls a person, whether it is illness, poverty, or the like, to Allah's Universal Will and Predestination. 

As for saying "**Allah and His Messenger know best**," this was permissible during the lifetime of the Messenger (peace be upon him), but after his death, we should say "**Allah knows best**," because the Messenger (peace be upon him) does not know what is happening after his death.
