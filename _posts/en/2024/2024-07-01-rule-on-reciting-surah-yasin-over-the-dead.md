### Question: 
What is the ruling on reciting the Surah of Ya-Sin over the dead, with the intention of dedicating the reward to them? Is that permissible? If it is, what is the evidence?

### Answer: 
Reciting the Qur'an with the intention of dedicating the reward to the deceased person is bid'ah (religious innovation), because there is no evidence to support that act. Furthermore, a Hadith has been reported concerning the recitation of Surah Ya-Sin upon the dying person, but it is a da'if (weak) Hadith that does not stand as proof. Therefore, it is impermissible to continue doing this bid'ah.
