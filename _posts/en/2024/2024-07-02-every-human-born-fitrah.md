### Question: 
Is the religion one is born into the true one? 

### Answer: 
Every human is born in a state of fitrah (divinely endowed natural disposition of monotheism/Islam). The Prophet ﷺ said: “**Every child is born in a state of fitrah, then his parents make him into a Jew or a Christian or a Magian.**” (agreed upon). However, Fitrah alone is not enough to know the details of Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah /monotheism) and how to worship Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He). It is incumbent to learn and try to become versed in religion; to follow and obey the Messenger of Allah ﷺ who conveyed all details that the servants need about religion and ibadah (worship). This is the way a Muslim can know the ibadah for which Allah created humanity. Allah (Glorified be He) says: “**And I (Allah) created not the jinns and humans except they should worship Me (Alone).**” (Adh-Dhariyat: 56)
