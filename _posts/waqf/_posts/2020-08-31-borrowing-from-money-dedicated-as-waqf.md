Question: 

I have a plot of arable land owned by my father as a Waqf (endowment). I take care of it and pay the wage of the farmers and reclaim it out of my own money. One day, I bought some objects by borrowing money from that which was dedicated for Waqf being in need of it at that time. However, I returned the money and more. Am I sinful to have done so? Please answer me. May Allah reward you well!

Answer:

If the reality is as you mentioned, meaning, that you returned the money you took for a good purpose and more, you are not sinful. However, it would have been more precautionary if you had borrowed from elsewhere. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
