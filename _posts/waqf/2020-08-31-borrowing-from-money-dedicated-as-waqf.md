Question: 

I have a plot of arable land owned by my father as a Waqf (endowment). I take care of it and pay the wage of the farmers and reclaim it out of my own money. One day, I bought some objects by borrowing money from that which was dedicated for Waqf being in need of it at that time. However, I returned the money and more. Am I sinful to have done so? Please answer me. May Allah reward you well!

Answer:

If the reality is as you mentioned, meaning, that you returned the money you took for a good purpose and more, you are not sinful. However, it would have been more precautionary if you had borrowed from elsewhere.
