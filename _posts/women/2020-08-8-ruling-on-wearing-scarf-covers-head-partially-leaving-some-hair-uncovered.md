### Question: 

Is it permissible for a woman to cover her head with a scarf that covers the head partially leaving some hair uncovered?

### Answer: 

A woman's head as a whole including her hair is `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), which she must fully cover in the presence of Ajanib (men other than a husband or permanently unmarriageable male relatives). It is not sufficient to partially cover her head with a scarf, leaving some hair uncovered, in the presence of Ajanib.
