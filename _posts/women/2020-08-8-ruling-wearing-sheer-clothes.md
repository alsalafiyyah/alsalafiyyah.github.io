Question: 

What is the ruling on women wearing sheer clothes?

Answer: 

It is not permissible for women to wear sheer clothes. Whoever does this is considered to be of those women that are dressed yet naked, whom the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated will not enter Paradise nor smell its fragrance.
