### Question: 

What is the ruling on women trimming eyebrows?

### Answer: 

It is not permissible for women to remove anything from eyebrows whether by trimming, cutting, or shaving. This is considered Nams (removing hair from the face/eyebrows) and the Prophet peace be upon him) cursed women who did this. Nams, therefore, is considered one of the major sins.
