Question: 

What is the ruling on women trimming eyebrows?

Answer: 

It is not permissible for women to remove anything from eyebrows whether by trimming, cutting, or shaving. This is considered Nams (removing hair from the face/eyebrows) and the Prophet peace be upon him) cursed women who did this. Nams, therefore, is considered one of the major sins. 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions.
