Question: 

What is the ruling on women wearing a brassiere?

Answer: 

Wearing a brassiere defines women's breasts and makes them a source of Finah (temptation), and as such, they are not permitted to wear them in front of non-Mahram (not a spouse or an unmarriageable relative) men.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions.
