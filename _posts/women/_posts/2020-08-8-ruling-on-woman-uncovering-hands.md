Question: 

Is it permissible for a woman to uncover her hands in public or not?

Answer: 

The palms of a woman's hands are 'Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), which may not be uncovered in the presence of non-Mahrams (spouse or unmarriageable relative). 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions.
