Question: 

What is your opinion of a man who does not order his female household to cover themselves in front of non-Mahrams (not a spouse or unmarriageable relatives)?

Answer: 

Whoever neglects his responsibility towards his female family members and does not order them to cover their `Awrah (parts of the body that must be covered in public), including the face and hands, has not carried out his guardianship properly and is sinful like them. It was authentically reported from the Prophet (peace be upon him) that he said: "**All of you are guardians and are responsible for your charges.**" [^1]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions.
