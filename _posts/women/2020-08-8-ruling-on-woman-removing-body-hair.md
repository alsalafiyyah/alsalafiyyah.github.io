Question: 

I asked you previously about the ruling on a woman's plucking of excessive hair from her body and you - may Allah bless you - replied but did not mention evidences. Kindly, provide me with the supportive evidences.

Answer: 

The evidence is that permissibility is the basic ruling. Besides, a woman has to beautify herself for her husband and there is no other evidence against this except the Prophet's prohibition of Nams (removing hair from the face/eyebrows).
