### Question: 

What is the ruling on a man whose female members of his family go out wearing transparent clothing? What is the ruling on a woman who utters curses in her husband's house and curses her children? Please advise us regarding these two questions. May Allah reward you the best.

### Answer: 

First, it is Haram (prohibited) for women to leave their houses in thin clothing. Their Waliy (guardians) should gently order and obligate them not to go out in such clothing. 

Second, it is not permissible for a woman to curse her children in her husband's house or in any other place.
