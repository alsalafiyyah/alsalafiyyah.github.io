Question: 

Is it obligatory for women to dress in black when going out, or can they wear any color as long as it is not an attractive color?

Answer: 

It is not obligatory for women to dress in black; they can wear any other color that is typical of women, provided that they do not attract attention or arouse Fitnah (temptation). 

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions.
