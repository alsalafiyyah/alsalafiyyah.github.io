Question: 

Is it obligatory for women to dress in black when going out, or can they wear any color as long as it is not an attractive color?

Answer: 

It is not obligatory for women to dress in black; they can wear any other color that is typical of women, provided that they do not attract attention or arouse Fitnah (temptation).
