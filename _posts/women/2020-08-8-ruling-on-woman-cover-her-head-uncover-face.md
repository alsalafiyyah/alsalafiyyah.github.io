Question: 

If a woman wears clothes covering her head while uncovering her face and wears a garment covering everything down to her heels and elbows, will this be considered wearing the clothes ordained for Muslim women?

Answer: 

It is ordained for a woman to wear clothes that conceal her whole body, including her face and hands.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet, his family and Companions.
