Question: 

Some people claim that if a man makes his wife wear the Hijab (veil) and stay at home, or wear black clothes, her Salah (Prayer) will be invalid; and he will be in Hellfire forever. The believing women who guard their private parts but wear black; however, modest it is, will also be in Hellfire forever.

Answer: 

This claim is speaking in the Name of Allah (Exalted be He) without knowledge and ruling according to one's own desires, whereas Allah (Exalted be He) says, "**And follow not (O man i.e., say not, or do not or witness not) that of which you have no knowledge.**" [al-Isra: 36]
