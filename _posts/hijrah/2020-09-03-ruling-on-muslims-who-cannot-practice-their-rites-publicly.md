Question:

In Britain it is not allowed to call the Adhan (call to Prayer) loudly except inside the Masjid (mosque). Muslims can not break the English law. Does this mean they are sinners? 

Answer:

It is impermissible to reside in a country where the Muslims are prevented from performing the Islamic rituals. If possible, the person should migrate to another country where Muslims are a majority and where they can perform the Islamic rituals overtly and find the means to cooperate with Muslims in righteousness and piety. They should be certain that their sustenance is available. Whoever fears Allah (Exalted be He) and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way out for him (from every difficulty), and He will provide him from (sources) he never could have imagined. Moreover, whoever puts his trust in Allah (Exalted be He), He will suffice him. Verily, Allah (Exalted be He) will accomplish his purpose.

Indeed, He has set a measure for all things. On the other hand, if migration is within their ability, but they prefer to stay in such countries where it is not possible to perform the Islamic rituals, they are sinful. Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): "In what (condition) were you?" They reply: "We were weak and oppressed on the earth." They (angels) say: "Was not the earth of All√¢h spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?" Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil destination!**" [al-Nisa: 97]
