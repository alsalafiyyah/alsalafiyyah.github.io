Question:

Does migration become obligatory upon a Muslim who feels insecure about himself or fears falling into Fitnah (sedition) if he remains in his own country? Where should he migrate to? 

Answer:

If the reality is as you have mentioned, it is permissible for a Muslim to migrate from his homeland to another land where he feels secure about himself and his religion.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
