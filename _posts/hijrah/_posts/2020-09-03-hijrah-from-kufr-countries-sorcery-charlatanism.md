Question:

Hijrah (a believer's migration to an Islamic land) does not end until the coming of the Day of Resurrection. I live in a non-Muslim country replete with charlatans, foretellers, and sorcerers. However, I am a believing Muslim who loves Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him), but I do not know what to do in this country and I can not find suitable husbands for my daughters. What is the ruling in this regard? 

Answer:

If the state is as you mentioned, you are obliged to immigrate to a country where your Din (religion) is secure and where there are others to cooperate with you in virtue and Taqwa (fear/wariness of offending Allah). This will also help you to find a righteous woman to marry as well as righteous husbands for your daughters, if Allah wills. If you are unable to immigrate, you should abandon all these sects. If this is difficult for you, then you must hold tight to the Din of Allah until you die, for Allah (Exalted be He) says: "**Verily! As for those whom the angels take (in death) while they are wronging themselves (as they stayed among the disbelievers even though emigration was obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to them): "In what (condition) were you?" They reply: "We were weak and oppressed on the earth." They (angels) say: "Was not the earth of All√¢h spacious enough for you to emigrate therein?" Such men will find their abode in Hell - What an evil destination! Except the weak ones among men, women**" [al-Nisa: 97-98]

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
