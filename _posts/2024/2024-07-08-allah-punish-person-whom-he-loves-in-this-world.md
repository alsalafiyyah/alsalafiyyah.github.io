### Question:
How correct is the statement '**Allah will punish the person whom He loves beforehand in this world**'? Does (affliction with) disease belong to the punishment by which sins are forgiven? 

### Answer: 
At-Tirmidhi (may Allah be merciful to him) related on the authority of Anas (may Allah be pleased with him) that the Prophet ﷺ said: **"When Allah wills good for His Slave, He hastens to punish them in this worldly life, and when He wills evil for His Slave, He withholds punishing them for their sin until they come to Him with that sin on the Day of Resurrection."** It shares similarities with other Hadiths. Punishments are of numerous types, some of which include illness and so on until the servant meets his Lord (i.e. passes away) and no sin is recorded for him.
