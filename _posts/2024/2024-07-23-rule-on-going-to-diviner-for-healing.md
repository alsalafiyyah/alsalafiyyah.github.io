### Question: 
What is the ruling on going to Al-Sayyid (enchanter) in cases of serious disease. It should be noted that the diseased person has an incurable disease. But Al-Sayyid cured many people of this disease and they recovered with Allah's Will. We believe that it is Allah Who grants recovery. Some people objected to this but we reply that Al-Sayyid is a means to bring recovery just like a doctor. What is the view of Your Eminence on this?

### Answer: 
It is permissible for a diseased person to be treated with permissible medicines and the Shar'i (Islamically lawful) Ruqyah (reciting Qur'an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing). On the other hand, it is unlawful to go to soothsayers and diviners who claim the knowledge of the unseen and work with talisman and polytheistic spells even if people describe them as Al-Sayyid.
