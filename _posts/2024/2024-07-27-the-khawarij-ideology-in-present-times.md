### Question:
Are those who carry the ideology of the Khawaarij present today?

### Answer:
Far removed is Allaah from all imperfections! And that which is happening today, is it not from the actions of the Khawarij? And it is declaring the Muslims to be disbelievers, and more severe than that is the killing of the Muslims and transgressing against them through terrorist activities. 

And this is the manhaj of the Khawarij, it comprises of three aspects:

1. Firstly - Takfir of the Muslims.
2. Secondly - Disobedience to the ruler.
3. Thirdly - Making permissible the blood of the Muslims.

This is the manhaj of the Khawarij, and even if a person believed it in his heart and did not speak (with any of it) or did not act out any of it, he would still become a Khariji in his belief and opinion, which he did not express openly.
