### Question: 
The Egyptians claim that the head of Al-Husayn is buried in Egypt, and the Iraqis have a Masjid (mosque) that they call Al-Mashhad Al-Husayni. I do not know how true that is. Where is the grave of Al-Husayn, according to scholarly view?

### Answer: 
Al-Husayn (may Allah be pleased with him) was killed in Iraq in Muharram, 61 A.H. And his body was buried in Iraq. As for the claim that his head was taken to Egypt and buried there, we do not know of any basis for this, but it was denied by some of the scholars. There is no harm if you do not know the answer to this question; what is prescribed for you and for other Muslims is to ask Allah to be pleased with him and with all the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet, may Allah be pleased with them).
