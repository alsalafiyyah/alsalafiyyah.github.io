### Question: 
What is the ruling on people who recite the Qur'an on others bearing in mind that some of them call up the Jinn (creatures created from fire), make them testify, and take their promise not to harm those on whom the recitation is made?

### Answer: 
Ruqyah (reciting Qur'an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) is permissible to be done by one Muslim for another. The Prophet ﷺ allowed Ruqyah so long as it did not entail any Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). However, it is impermissible to use the Jinn, make them testify, and take their promise not to harm those on whom the recitation is made.
