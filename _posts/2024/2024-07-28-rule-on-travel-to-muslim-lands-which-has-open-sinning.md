### Question:
What is the ruling of travelling to Islamic Lands - where there is no ordering the good and no forbidding the evil, and where alcohol and music is sold, and where there is tabarruj [the unveiling of women] and free mixing [of men and women] - for the purpose of trips and tourism.

### Answer:
The land which is not upon practicing the religion and one which has open lewdness and evil within it, then it is not allowed for a person to travel to it; since he will be affected by the evil found therein and be afflicted with that which its people have been afflicted with.
