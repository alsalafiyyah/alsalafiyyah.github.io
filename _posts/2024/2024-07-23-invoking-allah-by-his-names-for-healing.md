### Question: 
Can Muslims make Du'a (supplication) to Allah using His Names for the cure of their illnesses?

### Answer: 
It is permissible to do so due to the general saying of Allah (Exalted be He): **"And (all) the Most Beautiful Names belong to Allâh, so call on Him by them"**. 

This is also authentically reported from the Prophet ﷺ. He ﷺ pronounced Ruqyah (reciting Qur'an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing) by saying: **"O Lord of the people! Remove the difficulty and bring about healing as You are the Healer. There is no healing but Your Healing."**
