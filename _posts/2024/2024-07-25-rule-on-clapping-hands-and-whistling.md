### Question:
What is the ruling on people whistling and clapping their hands in parties?

### Answer:
This practice appears to be taken from non-Muslims; therefore, it is not an appropriate thing for a Muslim to do. When a Muslim is joyful about something, he says **Allahuakbar (Allah is the greatest)**; or **Subhanallah (How perfect Allah is!)**. 

Furthermore, it is incorrect to say **'Allahuakbar'** in unison with a group, as some people do. A person should say this by himself; there is no basis to saying so in unison with others.
