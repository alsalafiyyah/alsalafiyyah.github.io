### Question:
May Allaah reward you, noble shaykh, what is your opinion with regards to the one who says: that which is intended by "**those in authority**" that are mentioned in the Ayah (Qur'anic Verse) they are the Ulema (scholars) and not the Rulers?

### Answer:
This is a mistake, because the Aayah is inclusive, including the Ulemaa and the Rulers, this is what is correct. Indeed it includes the Rulers and the Ulema, it is said about all of them: "O you who believe! Obey Allah and obey the Messenger (Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)), and **those of you (Muslims) who are in authority**." (An-Nisa'(4):59)
