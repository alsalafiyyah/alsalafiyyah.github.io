### Question:
A group of people visits a Masjid (mosque) wherein is buried a Waliy (a pious person) called **Saydi Arwaz**. They try to draw closer to him by offering gifts, including coverlets and candles, and they slaughter sacrificial animals there. They do this believing that this Waliy will send their Du‘a’ (supplication) to Allah (Glorified be He). When we asked about this belief, they said that during the French occupation of Algeria, the French Forces fired heavy artillery at this Masjid and could not destroy it. In fact the cannon balls bounced back and killed many of the French soldiers. We would like to know the ruling of the Din (religion of Islam) on this.

### Answer: 
Visiting the graves of the Awliya' (pious people) for the purpose of seeking their blessings or drawing closer to them to ask for their needs to be fulfilled, is an act of Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship) and it is not permissible. Anyone who does this is a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), because it involves performing worship to other than Allah (Exalted be He). Allah (Exalted be He) says: **"...so invoke not anyone along with Allâh."** (Al-Jinn : 18).
