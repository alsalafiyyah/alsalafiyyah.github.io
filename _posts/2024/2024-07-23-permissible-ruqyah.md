### Question: 
Is it permissible for Muslims to use all kinds of Ruqyah (reciting Qur'an and saying supplications over the sick seeking healing)?

### Answer: 
Ruqyah is permissible if it does not entail any Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship), such as using Surahs (chapters) and Ayahs (verses) from the Qur'an, or verified forms of Dhikr (remembrance of Allah). However, it is unlawful if it leads to any Shirk such as reciting the names of Jinn (creatures created from fire) or pious people over the patient and saying incomprehensible words. This is impermissible because they may contain Shirk. It is confirmed that the Prophet ﷺ said, **"There is no harm in Ruqyah as long as it does not entail Shirk."** (Related by Muslim).
