### Question: 
What is your opinion regarding those who claim to have landed on the moon which we, as Muslims, consider one of Allah's signs?

### Answer: 
The knowledge about this matter will not increase or decrease our faith. Thus, we should neither believe nor deny what they say. It is preferable to stop talking about this, for the Muslim who is legally responsible should preoccupy himself with the beneficial Islamic knowledge he needs, such as the knowledge of Aqidah (creed) and Shari`ah (Islamic law).
