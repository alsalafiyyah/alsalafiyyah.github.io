### Question:
Does rebellion against the rulers occur only by the sword or does it include slandering them, inciting the people to disobey them and rising up against them?

### Answer:
We have mentioned this and have said that rebellion against the rulers occurs by the sword which is the most extreme form of rebellion and it also occurs by speech, by way of criticising, abusing, and speaking about them in gatherings and on pulpits. This agitates and encourages the people to rebel against the ruler and belittles the ruler in front of their eyes. So speech is a form of rebellion.
