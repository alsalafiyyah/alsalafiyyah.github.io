### Question: 
I do not feel submission or the sweetness of faith. This may happen at times of diversity and calamities. What is the solution to this? Please advise me, may Allah reward you. 

### Answer: 
A Muslim should depend on Allah and hold firm to His Rope in bringing benefit and removing harm. If a person is inflicted with a calamity or adversity, they should be patient and seek Allah's Reward for it. A person should also know that these things are inflicted by Allah's Decree and Predestination. They should ask Allah to remove this adversity and to compensate them with what is good. They should say what is legislated by Allah in cases of calamities. Allah (Exalted be He) says: **"...but give glad tidings to As-Sâbirûn (the patient). Who, when afflicted with calamity, say: "Truly! To Allâh we belong and truly, to Him we shall return."** (al-Baqarah:155-156). A person should also do righteous deeds and avoid evil ones in order to find the sweet taste of faith.
