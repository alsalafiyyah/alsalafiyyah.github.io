### Question: 
How can glory and might be to Muslims when they are so weak in a corrupted world that Christians and Jews predominate?

### Answer:
Muslims can not achieve glory, overcome their enemies, or have power in the land unless they obey Allah (Exalted be He) and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and act upon Islam and Iman (Faith) inwardly and outwardly. There are proofs for this in the Qur'an, Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet), and Athar (narrations from the Companions). 

Allah (Exalted be He) states: **"Give to the hypocrites the tidings that there is for them a painful torment. Those who take disbelievers for Auliyâ’ (protectors or helpers or friends) instead of believers, do they seek honour, power and glory with them? Verily, then to Allâh belongs all honour, power and glory."** [An-Nisa' : 138-139]

He (Glorified be He) also states: **"Verily, Allâh will help those who help His (Cause). Truly, Allâh is All-Strong, All-Mighty. Those (Muslim rulers) who, if We give them power in the land, (they) enjoin Iqamat-as-Salât [i.e. to perform the five compulsory congregational Salât (prayers) (the males in mosques)], pay the Zakât and they enjoin Al-Ma‘rûf (i.e. Islâmic Monotheism and all that Islâm orders one to do), and forbid Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief, polytheism and all that Islâm has forbidden) [i.e. they make the Qur’ân as the law of their country in all the spheres of life]. And with Allâh rests the end of (all) matters (of creatures)."** [Al-Hajj: 40-41]

Moreover, He (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: **"Allâh has promised those among you who believe and do righteous good deeds, that He will certainly grant them succession to (the present rulers) in the land, as He granted it to those before them, and that He will grant them the authority to practise their religion which He has chosen for them (i.e. Islâm). And He will surely give them in exchange a safe security after their fear (provided) they (believers) worship Me and do not associate anything (in worship) with Me."** [An-Nur: 55]

In addition, He (Glorified and Exalted be He) states: **"O you who believe! If you help (in the cause of) Allâh, He will help you, and make your foothold firm."** [Muhammad: 7]

Similarly, there are many other glorious Ayahs (Qur'anic verses) that clarify that Muslims' fulfillment of their religious duties, i.e. believing in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah), exalting and glorifying Allah, acting upon the Qur'an and Sunnah, performing Salah (Prayer), giving Zakah (obligatory charity), loving pious believers, abhorring the enemies of Allah amongst the hypocrites and the Kafirs (disbelievers), and waging Jihad (fighting/striving in the Cause of Allah) against them so that the Word of Allah becomes uppermost and Kafirs are abased, etc. Are preconditions for granting Muslims power and glory in the land.

On the other hand, it is authentically reported on the authority of Ibn 'Umar that the Prophet (peace be upon him) stated: **"I have been sent ahead of the Hour with the sword so that Allah will be worshipped Alone, and my provision has been placed in the shade of my spear, and humiliation has been decreed for those who go against my command, and whoever imitates a people is one of them."** (Related by Imam Ahmad and Abu Dawud). This Hadith thus implies that whoever violates the Prophet's command will have a portion of humiliation according to their disobedience. 

Al-Hafidh Ibn Rajab (may Allah be Merciful to him) said while explaining this Hadith: **"One of the greatest reasons of humiliation that results from violating the command of the Prophet (peace be upon him) is to abandon Jihad. Whoever follows the way of the Prophet regarding Jihad is granted glory, and whoever abandons Jihad though they are able to conduct it is humiliated. Another proof for this is the following Hadith: "When you enter into the `Inah sale (sale with immediate cash repurchase for profit), follow the tails of oxen, and give up conducting Jihad, Allah will make disgrace prevail over you, and will not withdraw it until you return to your true Din 'religion'." Ibn Rajab proceeded, whoever then abandons the Jihad that the Prophet (peace be upon him) used to perform, though they are able to conduct it, and busy themselves with seeking worldly Mubah (permissible) gains; they will be humiliated. What then will be their punishment if they abandon Jihad for being busy with accumulating the Haram (prohibited) gains of this world?"**

Our Salaf (righteous predecessors) amongst the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophet) and those who followed them acknowledged the fact that all glory lies in adherence to Islam, following the Prophet (peace be upon him), and doing one's best to obey Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him) and avoid disobeying them. 

Our Salaf expressed this fact in their own words such as what is authentically reported from Amir Al-Mu’minin (Commander of the Believers) 'Umar ibn Al-Khattab (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: **"We are people to whom Allah granted the glory of Islam so if we seek glory in anything other than it 'Islam', Allah will humiliate us."**

Also, it is authentically reported from Abu Al-Darda' (may Allah be pleased with him) that **when Muslims conquered Cyprus and its people wept and were in great sadness and humiliation, Abu Al-Darda' (may Allah be pleased with him) began to weep as well. Jubayr ibn Nufayr asked him: "O Abu Al-Darda' why do you weep on a day that Allah grants glory to Islam and Muslims?" He (may Allah be pleased with him) replied: "O Jubayr, how very despicable people become in the sight of Allah (Glorified and Exalted be He) when they neglect His Command. While they were a powerful and mighty Ummah (nation) and the reign was for them, they abandoned the Command of Allah and thus their status changed as you now see."**

In conclusion, every Muslim is responsible according to their ability to ensure glory for the believers. Every Muslim has thus to adhere to the Command of Allah (Exalted be He), to act inwardly and outwardly upon Islam, to advise Muslim fellows, to enjoin Ma`ruf (that which is judged as good, beneficial, or fitting by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect), and to forbid Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) until the affairs of Muslims improve or one dies while obeying Allah to the best of one's ability. Verily, it is Allah Alone whose help is to be sought.
