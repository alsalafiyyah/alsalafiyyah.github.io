### Question: 
Is it permissible to stand for a minute of silence in memory of the martyrs? Whenever specific social events start here, the people stand for a minute of silence to mourn or honor the martyrs.

### Answer: 
Some people do stand in silence for a while in memory of the martyrs or dignitaries or as a way of honoring and mourning them, this is considered as Munkar (that which is unacceptable or disapproved of by Islamic law and Muslims of sound intellect) and bid'ah (innovation in religion), as it was not done during the lifetime of the Prophet (peace be upon him), his Sahabah (Companions), or the Salaf (righteous predecessors), nor does this conform to the proprieties of Tawhid (monotheism) and sincere glorification of Allah Alone. 

In fact, some Muslims who lack knowledge of their religion imitate the disbelieving originators of this Bid`ah and follow their ugly habits and exaggeration in honoring their rulers and celebrities, whether they are alive or dead. The Prophet (peace be upon him) prohibited imitation of the disbelievers. 

Among the rights that are known in Islam are supplicating to Allah for deceased Muslims, giving Sadaqah (voluntary charity) on their behalf, mentioning their virtues, and refraining from mentioning their evils. 

There are many other proprieties that Islam has clarified and urged Muslims to observe with their fellow Muslims, whether they are alive or dead; standing silently in memory of the martyrs or well-known personalities is not among them. Actually, the basic principles of Islam reject such a ritual.
