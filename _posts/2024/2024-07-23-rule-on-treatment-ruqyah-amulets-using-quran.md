### Question: 
What is the ruling on treating the sick, making Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection) or amulets or charms using the Qur'an?

### Answer: 
Firstly: It is permissible to treat sick people with the Qur'an. It was reported in the Two Sahih (authentic) Books of Hadith (i.e. Al-Bukhari and Muslim) on the authority of Abu Sa`id Al-Khudry that he said: **"Some of the Sahabah (Companions of the Prophetﷺ) set out on a journey and traveled until they came near one of the Arab tribes (at night). They asked them for hospitality but they refused. The chief of that tribe was then bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and they tried their best to cure him but in vain. Some of them said, 'Why do not we go to the people who stayed here at night? It may be that some of them might have something (as treatment).' They went to the group of the Sahabah and said, 'Our chief has been bitten by a snake (or stung by a scorpion) and we have tried everything but nothing benefited him. Have you got anything (useful)?' One of them replied, 'Yes, by Allah! I can recite Ruqyah for him, but by Allah as you have refused to accept us as your guests, I will not recite the Ruqyah for you unless you give us something in return.' They agreed to pay them a flock of sheep. One of the Sahabah then started to blow on him and recite (Surah Al-Fatihah): All the praises and thanks be to Allâh, the Lord of the ‘Alamîn (mankind, jinn and all that exists). The chief then became as energetic as if he was released from chains, and got up and started walking, showing no signs of sickness. They paid them what they agreed on. Some of them (i.e. the Sahabah) then suggested to divide their earnings among themselves, but the one who performed the Ruqyah said, 'Do not anything until we go to the Prophet ﷺ and narrate the whole story to him and wait for his order.' Therefore, they went to the Messenger of Allah ﷺ and narrated the story. The Messenger of Allah ﷺ asked, 'How did you know that Surah Al-Fatihah is a Ruqyah?' Then he ﷺ added, 'You did the right thing. Divide (what you have earned) and assign a share for me as well.'"** This Hadith denotes the permissibility of the treatment with the Qur'an. 

Secondly: Having amulets that contain some parts of the Qur'an is prohibited according to the more correct of the two opinions maintained by scholars in this regard. This is based on the general ruling given in the Hadiths that denote the prohibition of wearing or hanging amulets to block the means leading to sins.
