### Question:
What is the ruling regarding the one who disobeys the rulers or criticises them?

### Answer:
Whoever disobeys the command of the ruler then he has disobeyed the Messenger ﷺ. As long as the ruler does not order him with sinning, then disobedience of him is the disobedience of the Messenger ﷺ. 

Similarly if he criticises the ruler, then this is the madhab of the Khawarij who criticise the rulers, speak about them and incite the people against them. The young rabble who rose up against Uthmaan did not do so except due to the vile Ibn Saba’. He began to speak in the gatherings and incite the people until the foolish people began to rage, and this ended in the killing of Uthman (may Allah be pleased with him). And what tribulations were the Muslims thrown into due to his killing? Things that would make the hair turn grey due the killing of the Caliph and rebelling against him.
