### Question: 
Can Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) aid anyone in times of distress?

### Answer: 
Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) was killed and was not even aware of his killer’s plot, nor was he able to protect himself from it. How, then, can it be claimed that he can ward off calamities from others after his death, when he could not ward it off himself when he was alive? A person who believes that ‘Ali, or any other dead person, can bring benefit or ward off harm is a Mushrik (one who associates others with Allah in worship), because this is particular to Allah, the Exalted, alone. Whoever attributes this to anyone else out of belief in him or for seeking his help, has taken him as a god. Allah the Exalted says (what means): **"And if Allâh touches you with harm, there is none who can remove it but He, and if He intends any good for you, there is none who can repel His Favour which He causes it to reach whomsoever of His slaves He wills. And He is the Oft-Forgiving, the Most Merciful."** (Yunus, 10: 107)
