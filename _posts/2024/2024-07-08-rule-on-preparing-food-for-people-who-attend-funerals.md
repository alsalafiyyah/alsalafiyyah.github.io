### Question: 
Is it permissible for the family of the deceased to cook food during the same day in which a person passes away to serve it to those who attend the funeral procession, and that the food should be served before burying the dead? Those who do this take the Ayahs of Sadaqah (voluntary charity) and spending in the way of Allah as proof in this regard. They also say that the grave is dark and serving food for people will lighten the grave before the deceased enters it.

### Answer: 
Preparing food for the people who attend the Funeral is an act of bid'ah (deviant innovation) and an act of jahiliyyah (pre-Islamic time of ignorance). As for the claim that the grave is dark and serving food by the people of the deceased and giving charity on his behalf before burying him will lighten the darkness of the grave before he goes into the grave, this has no origin and saying this is a matter of guesswork because it is a matter of the Ghayb (Unseen) which no one but Allah knows.
