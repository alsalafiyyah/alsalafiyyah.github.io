### Question: 
There are invocations claimed to protect against scorpions which have been tried and proven effective. It reads: "O Allah! This is the spell of scorpions and reptiles passed by the Jews and Christians. It says: 'What makes you cry, O Messenger of Allah?' He said, 'A reptile consigned to Hellfire; its tail like a saw with small chest like a dinar. Gabriel descended on its blood. Gabriel descended on its poison crying out thrice to Allah, 'Be admitted to Allah's Glory and written in a Preserved Tablet.'" 

What is the ruling on this? May Allah reward you.

### Answer: 
The Ruqyah (recitation for healing or protection) you mentioned is false. Only authentic Ruqyah with Qur'an and supplications authentically reported from the Prophet ﷺ is permissible. An example of this is the Ruqyah made by Abu Sa'id Al-Khudry with Surah Al-Fatihah for healing a Kafir (disbeliever). Consequently, it is not permissible to use this Ruqyah; rather, it must be discarded and warned against.
