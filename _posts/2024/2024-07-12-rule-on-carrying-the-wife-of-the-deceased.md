### Question: 
Some peple, if a man dies, a woman who has not menstruated carries his wife around his grave seven times to the right and seven times to the left. Some people advised them not to do this, but they paid no heed to their advice. Please direct us to the right solution. Is that practice permissible or is it an act of Bid`ah?

### Answer: 
This practice is prohibited as it is considered an act of Bid`ah (innovation in religion or an act that was not legislated by Allah and His Messenger). Introducing innovations in religion is not permissible.
