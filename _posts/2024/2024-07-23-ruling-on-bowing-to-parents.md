### Question: 
Is it permissible to perform Ruku‘ (bowing) to one’s parents?

### Answer: 
This is impermissible and is tantamount to Shirk (associating others with Allah in His Divinity or worship). Ruku‘ is a form of worship, just like Sujud (prostration); therefore, it is impermissible to bow or prostrate before anyone other than Allah the Exalted.
