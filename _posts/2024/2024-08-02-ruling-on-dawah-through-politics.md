### Question: 
Which is better; to work for the benefit of Islam through politics or through calling people to work according to the example of the Prophet (peace be upon him)?

### Answer: 
It is your duty to work for Islam through calling the people to the Book of Allah and the Sunnah of the Prophet (peace be upon him) according to the methodology with which Allah guided and commanded the Prophet (peace be upon him) saying: **"Invite (mankind, O Muhammad (peace be upon him)) to the Way of your Lord (i.e. Islâm) with wisdom (i.e. with the Divine Revelation and the Qur’ân) and fair preaching, and argue with them in a way that is better."** [An-Nahl: 125]

And His saying: **"Say (O Muhammad (peace be upon him)): "This is my way; I invite unto Allâh (i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism) with sure knowledge, I and whosoever follows me (also must invite others to Allâh i.e. to the Oneness of Allâh - Islâmic Monotheism with sure knowledge). And Glorified and Exalted be Allâh (above all that they associate as partners with Him). And I am not of the Mushrikûn (polytheists, pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the Oneness of Allâh; those who worship others along with Allâh or set up rivals or partners to Allâh)."** [Yusuf: 108]

The Prophet (peace be upon him) explained the way of Da'wah (calling to Islam) to Allah by his sayings, dictations and actions, when he said: **"Whoever, among you, sees something abominable should rectify it with his hand; and if he has not strength enough to do it, then he should do it with his tongue; and if he has not strength enough to do it, (even) then he should (abhor it) by his heart, and that is the least degree of Iman (Faith)."** (Related by Ahmad, Muslim and the Compilers of the Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes)). 

He (peace be upon him) said to Mu'adh when he dispatched him to Yemen : **"You will soon find yourself in a community of the People of the Book, so first call them to testify that there is no god but Allah, and that I (Muhammad) am the Messenger of Allah; and if they accept this, tell them that Allah has enjoined upon them five Prayers during the day and night; and if they accept it, tell them that Allah has made Zakah obligatory upon them that it should be collected from the rich and distributed among the poor; and if they agree to it, do not pick up (as a share of Zakah) the best of their wealth. Beware of the supplication of the oppressed for there is no barrier between it and Allah."** (Related by Ahmad, Al-Bukhari, Muslim and the Compilers of the Sunan (Hadith compilations classified by jurisprudential themes)).

In the Hadith narrated on the authority of Sahl ibn Sa'd (may Allah be pleased with him) the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to 'Ali (may Allah be pleased with him) when he gave him the command banner on the Day of Khaybar: **"Advance cautiously until you reach their open places; thereafter, invite them to Islam and inform them what is obligatory upon them from the Rights of Allah, for, by Allah, if Allah guides even one person through you that is better for you than possessing a whole lot of red camels."** (Related by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). 

The Prophet (peace be upon him) sent to the kings of the neighboring kingdoms to call them to Islam and command them to worship Allah Alone. He mentioned in his dictations to the people of the Book: **"O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word that is just between us and you, that we worship none but Allâh (Alone), and that we associate no partners with Him, and that none of us shall take others as lords besides Allâh."** [Aal 'Imran: 64] he promised them with double reward if they respond to his call and warned them against the bad end of their sins and the sins of their nations if they refused. 

Moreover, He (peace be upon him) called to Islam by his actions. He was a perfect example in Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah) and worship. He was at the highest moral standards through his biography and in dealing with the people where he was never upset or vengeful for himself but he used to get angry if the boundaries of Allah were violated. He was as Allah described him in His Glorious Book: **"for the believers (he, peace be upon him) full of pity, kind, and merciful."** [at-Tawbah: 128]

And in His saying: **"And Verily, you (O Muhammad (peace be upon him)) are on an exalted (standard of) character."** [al-Qalam: 4] Along with other examples of his explanation to the methodology of Da'wah by sayings, dictations and actions. 

This is the policy of the guided, wise and merciful call depicted by the Prophet (peace be upon him). The Du'ah (callers to Islam) of the Islamic groups should follow its way; the way of wisdom and good preaching and arguing in a better way and to address everyone by their status and address each one with what they understand, perhaps Allah grants victory to His religion through them. He may direct their arrows to the chests of their enemies not to their brethren for He is the One Who responds to supplication.
