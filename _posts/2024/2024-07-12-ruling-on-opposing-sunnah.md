### Question: 
Do the books of Hadith explain the Qur'an? Is it true that there is no Sunnan (supererogatory acts of worship following the example of the Prophet) in Islam and that a person has to adhere only to Faridah (obligatory acts)? Is it correct that to be saved from punishment in the Hereafter we have to abandon Sunnah (whatever is reported from the Prophet) and rely only on the Qur'an? 

### Answer: 
According to consensus of scholars, the purified Sunnah is the second source of evidence in Islam. The Sunnah explains the Qur'an. Anyone who denies the authority of the Sunnah is a kafir because they deny one of the agreed upon principles of Islam. Allah (Exalted be He) says: **"And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)) gives you, take it; and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)."** [Al-Hashr: 7]. Allah (Glorified be He) also says: **"And We have also sent down unto you (O Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him)) the Dhikr [reminder and the advice (i.e. the Qur’ân)], that you may explain clearly to men what is sent down to them."** [An-Nahl :44].
