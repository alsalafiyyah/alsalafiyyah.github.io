### Question: 
Is it permissible for a Muslim to become acquainted with communists and support them? What is the ruling on a person who does so? 

### Answer: 
It is impermissible for a Muslim to become acquainted with those who adopt false creeds, such as communists, Nasiriyyah, Druze, Qadyaniyyah and other corrupted sects, for other than a Shar'i (Islamically lawful) interest, lest they are affected by their false creeds and corrupted morals, or at the very least they may become notorious, according to the saying of the Prophet (peace be upon him), **"The similitude of good company and that of bad company is that of the owner of musk and of the one blowing bellows. As for the owner of musk, you would either buy from him; he would offer you free of charge; or you would smell its pleasant odor. As for the one who blows the bellows, he would either burn your clothes, or you shall have to smell its repugnant smell."** (Narrated by Al-Bukhari and Muslim). 

It is also impermissible to support them in their falsehood, as it entails cooperation in sin and transgression. Allah (Exalted be He) says, **"...but do not help one another in sin and transgression."** 

If a person mixes with them or helps them in falsehood, they have done wrong and injustice as much as they have helped them. They should advise them and guide them to the truth if they deserve it; otherwise, they should avoid them.
