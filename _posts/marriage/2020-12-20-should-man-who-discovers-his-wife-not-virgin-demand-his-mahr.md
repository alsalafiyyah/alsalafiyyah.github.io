Question:

In some countries, people like to see the virginal blood on the bride's garment and announce her virtuousness the next morning in daylight. If a husband finds his wife has no hymen and wants to conceal her secret, he is ordered to divorce her. In this case, should the bride's family give the husband back the Mahr (mandatory gift to a bride from her groom) he paid?

Answer:

If it is necessary to show the bride's virtuousness by blood on her garment according to their traditions, the husband can use any other blood to protect her, if otherwise she would be accused of Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage). The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**Whoever conceals (the faults) of a Muslim, Allah will conceal their faults in this life and in the Hereafter.**" [^1]
