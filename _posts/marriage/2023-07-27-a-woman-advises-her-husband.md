### Question:

If a woman advises her negligent husband to do his prayers in the mosque or she expresses anger with regard to that, is she guilty of sin, because his rights over her are so great?

### Answer: 

A woman is not guilty of sin if she advises her husband when he does something that Allaah has forbidden, such as taking the matter of prayer in congregation lightly or drinking intoxicants or staying up late at night. Rather she will be rewarded for that. What is prescribed is that the advice should be given in a kindly and polite manner, because that makes it more acceptable and more beneficial.
