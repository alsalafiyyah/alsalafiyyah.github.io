The Sunnah indicates that it is prescribed to get married, and that it is one of the Sunnahs of the Messengers. By getting married a person can, with the help of Allah, overcome many of the traps of evil, for marriage helps him to lower his gaze and guard his chastity, as the Prophet ﷺ said in the hadith, **“O young men, whoever among you can afford it, let him get married, for it is more effective in lowering the gaze and guarding chastity…”** (Agreed upon). 

Al-Hakim narrated in Al-Mustadrak from Anas, in a marfu’ report: **“Whomever Allah blesses with a righteous wife, He has helped him with half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.”**

Al-Bayhaqi narrated in Shu’ab Al-Iman from Al-Raqashi: **“When a person gets married he has completed half of his religion, so let him fear Allah with regard to the other half.”**

And Allah is the Source of strength.
