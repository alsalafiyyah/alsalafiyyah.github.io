Question:

I am a youth in the secondary stage. I endeavor as much as possible to observe the obligatory acts of worship and the commands of Islam. Yet the problem I suffer from is that I can't get married due to the financial problems prevailing these days and I am afraid to commit what Allah has forbidden. Is there some advice and instructions that you can direct to the youth like me? 

Answer:

I advise you and your brothers in Islam with what the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "**O young people! Whoever among you is able to marry, should marry, for marriage would help him lower his gaze and keep his virtuousness and whoever is not able to marry, is recommended to fast, for fasting will diminish his sexual desire.**" (Agreed upon by Al-Bukhari and Muslim)[^1]. 

O brother! Fear Allah and adhere to His Religion, and observe Sawm (Fast) as often as possible until you can marry. You should ask your Lord to grant you safety and steadfastness on what is right and to facilitate your affairs. You should have glad tidings of goodness and a noble end. Allah (Glorified be He) says: "**And whosoever fears All√¢h and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine.**" [Al-Talaq: 2-3] 

May Allah facilitate your affairs and the affairs of every Muslim for He is the Ever-Hearing, the Ever-Accepter of all invocations!
