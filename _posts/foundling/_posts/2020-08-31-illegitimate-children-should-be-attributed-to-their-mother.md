Question: 

I am a 24-year old man studying in America. Two years ago, I met an American girl and after few days I had sexual intercourse with her. Our relationship continued for a while and she became pregnant. I did not care and we continued our relationship until she delivered a female baby. Now, the child is a year and half old and lives with her mother. Dear respected Shaykh, I do not know what to do in this case, and I do not know the ruling of Islam on it. Should I marry this girl? Is the child attributed to me or to her mother? Should I leave her, return to Saudi Arabia, repent to Almighty Allah and forget everything?

Dear Shaykh, please answer me as soon as possible. I should mention that I will do whatever you say, but I am totally concerned with the child's future. I am very confused and fear doing something which I will regret the rest of my life. Please, give me a clear answer. May Allah reward you with the best.

Answer:

First, you have to turn to Allah in repentance for the crime of Zina (sexual intercourse outside marriage) which you committed, increase your good deeds and acts of obedience and avoid sins and bad company.

Second, the child, which came from Zina, should not be attributed to you but to her mother.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
