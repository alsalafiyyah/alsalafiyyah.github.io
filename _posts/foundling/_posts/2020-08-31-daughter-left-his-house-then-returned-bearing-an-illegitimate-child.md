Question: 

A man works in France and has a daughter which is not an upright Muslim. She left the house of her father and complained to the French authorities. He went to court and she remained in their custody for months and finally he received her, praise be to Allah. He returned her to their home country and left her at his brother's who would provide for her. A few months later, she left her uncle and the whole country. Then, she returned bearing an illegitimate male child. Her uncle and all her relatives refused to receive her, and her father told her that if she wanted to remain under his guardianship, he would send her money to be with her uncle but he would not accept the child. However, she refused to forsake her child while her father rejects her baby. What is your answer? Is the father wrong? What is the way out?

Answer:

The aforementioned people should protect their daughter and command her to repent to Allah for what she committed. They should hasten to marry her to a righteous man who will take care of her. As for the child, he is her son and they should be keen to bring him up correctly, and Allah forgives those who repent to Him.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
