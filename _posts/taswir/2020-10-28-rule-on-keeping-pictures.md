excerpt: "These photos should be disposed of if they are no longer needed. As for the Hadith: 'Except a design on a cloth,' it is reported in the Hadith indicating that angels do not enter a house in which there is a picture. Here 'a design on a cloth,' is interpreted as referring to cushions or mats, but this does not include what is hanged on walls, since the Prophet (peace be upon him) disapproved of Aishah's hanging a cloth including pictures."

Question: 

What is the ruling on personal photos one has?

Answer: 

These photos should be disposed of if they are no longer needed. As for the Hadith: "Except a design on a cloth," it is reported in the Hadith indicating that angels do not enter a house in which there is a picture. Here "a design on a cloth," is interpreted as referring to cushions or mats, but this does not include what is hanged on walls, since the Prophet (peace be upon him) disapproved of Aishah's hanging a cloth including pictures.
