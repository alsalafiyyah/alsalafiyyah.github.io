Question: 

We know that hanging pictures in homes is Haram (prohibited). Can we hang them in the bathroom, whether they are tridimensional or not?

Answer: 

It is obligatory to remove these pictures. You should not keep them either in the bathroom or anywhere else at home, for the Prophet (peace be upon him) said to Ali (may Allah be pleased with him): "**Spare no portrait unwiped out, and leave not a high grave unleveled.**" [^1]

Yet, if it is necessary to keep the photos due to plausible reasons, then one should keep them within a box and the like, and should not hang or put them either in the bathroom or anywhere else. May Allah grant us success.
