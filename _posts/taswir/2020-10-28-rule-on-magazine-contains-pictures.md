Question: 

What is the ruling on bringing home useful magazines and school books that contain pictures of living creatures? Does this come under the ruling introduced in the Hadith that reads: "**Angels do not enter a house in which there is a dog or a picture.**" [^1]?

Answer: 

You should wipe out the head (in the pictured) , and then there would be no objection to it. May Allah grant us success.
