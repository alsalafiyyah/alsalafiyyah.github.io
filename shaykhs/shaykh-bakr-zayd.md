### His Lineage:

Bakr ibn 'Abdullah Abu Zayd ibn Muhammad ibn 'Abdullah ibn Bakr ibn 'Uthman ibn Yahya ibn Ghayhab ibn Muhammad. He descended from the tribe of Zayd Al-A'la, who is Zayd ibn Suwayd ibn Zayd ibn Suwayd ibn Zayd ibn Haram ibn Zayd Al-Qada'i from the famous Bani Zayd Al-Qada'iyyah tribe from the Al-Washm area of  Najd, where he was born in 1365 A.H.

### His Educational Background:

Shaykh Bakr studied until the second year of elementary school, and then in 1375 A.H. he moved to Riyadh where he continued his elementary studies, joined the Educational Institute, and graduated from the Faculty of Shari`ah as an associate with first class honors in 1387 A.H./1388 A.H.

In 1384 A.H. he moved to Al-Madinah, where he worked as a librarian in the General Library of the Islamic University.

In addition to his regular studies, he attended the learning circles of many Shaykhs in Riyadh, Makkah, and Al-Madinah.

In Riyadh, he studied the science of Miqat (science of chronological or astronomical times for calculating ephemerides and the time of prayer) under Shaykh Salih ibn Mutlaq, and studied 25 points from Maqamat Al-Hariry, which his Shaykh had already memorized in its entirety. In Fiqh (Islamic jurisprudence), he studied the book of Al-Buyu` (Sales) from Al-Hajawi’s Zad Al-Mustaqni.

In Makkah, he studied the book of Hajj from Al-Majd ibn Taymiyyah’s Al-Muntaqa under Shaykh 'Abdul-Aziz ibn 'Abdullah ibn Baz (may Allah be merciful to him) during the Hajj season at Al-Masjid Al-Haram in 1385 A.H.

He sought authorization from a teacher in Al-Masjid Al-Haram, namely Shaykh Sulayman ibn `Abdul-Rahman ibn Hamdan, who personally wrote an authorization for him to teach all the books of the Sunnah.

In Al-Madinah, he studied Ibn Hajar’s Fath Al-Bary and Bulugh Al-Maram under Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah be merciful to him), including a number of theses in Fiqh, Tawhid (belief in the Oneness of Allah/monotheism), and Hadith in his house. In short, he frequented him for two years, after which Shaykh Ibn Baz (may Allah be merciful to him) authorized him to teach these books.

After moving to Al-Madinah, he also frequented Shaykh Muhammad Al-Amin Al-Shanqity (may Allah be merciful to him) for approximately 10 years, until the Shaykh (may Allah be merciful to him) died during Hajj in 1393 A.H. In Tafsir (explanation/exegesis of the meanings of the Qur'an), he studied the Shaykh’s Adwa' Al-Bayan, and the Shaykh’s thesis, Adab Al-Bahth Wal-Munazarah. He also studied Ibn `Abdul-Bar’s Al-Qasd Wal-Umam and some of Al-Inabah. In all, he has received approximately 20 authorizations (to teach different books of knowledge) from the scholars of Makkah, Al-Madinah, Riyadh, Morocco, Syria, India, and Africa, among others.

In 1399 A.H./1978 C.E., he studied at the High Judicial Institute as an associate, where he achieved a Master's degree, and in 1403 A.H./1982 C.E. he achieved a Doctorate.

### His Active Life:

After graduating from the Faculty of Shari`ah in 1387 A.H./1966 C.E., he was selected as a judge for Al-Madinah, whereby a Royal Decree was issued to appoint him. He continued in this post until 1400 A.H.

He was also a teacher in the Prophet’s Mosque from the time of his appointment in 1390 A.H. until 1400 A.H.

In 1391 A.H., a Royal Decree was issued appointing him as an Imam and preacher at the Prophet’s Mosque, and he continued in this post until the beginning of 1396 A.H.

In 1400 A.H., a decree was issued by the Council of Ministers selecting him as general procurator for the Ministry of Justice. He continued in this post until the end of 1412 A.H., when a Royal Decree was issued appointing him to the rank of excellence, and in turn a member of the Permanent Committee for Scholarly Research and Ifta', and also the Council of Senior Scholars.

In 1405 A.H., a Royal Decree was issued appointing him as representative of the Kingdom at the International Islamic Fiqh Academy, which was created by a decision made by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, and he was subsequently selected as President of the Academy.

In 1406 A.H., he was appointed as a member of the Fiqh Council of the Muslim World League.

The Shaykh has approximately 66 publications to his name, ranging from Hadith, Fiqh, Arabic, and others, with the number consistently rising due to his ongoing efforts. He is currently participating in a number of committees and conferences inside and outside the Kingdom.
