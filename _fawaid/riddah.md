With regard to apostasy from Islam, whereby a person becomes a kaafir, whether a mushrik or a Jew or Christian, if he dies in that state then all his good deeds will be wiped out, according to scholarly consensus, as the Qur’an says in more than one place. For example Allah says:

“**And whosoever of you turns back from his religion and dies as a disbeliever, then his deeds will be lost in this life and in the Hereafter**” [Al-Baqarah 2:217] 

“**And whosoever disbelieves in Faith, [i.e. in the Oneness of Allaah and in all the other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allaah’s) Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work**” [Al-Ma’idah 5:5] 

“**But if they had joined in worship others with Allaah, all that they used to do would have been of no benefit to them**” [Al-An’am 6:88]
