Question: 

I was born in France where I still live until now. I am 26 years old and my parents are Tunisian. I am married and have two children; the oldest is 4 years old and the second is 9 months old. I would like to migrate to one of the Arab countries, particularly to secure the future of my children and keep their religion and language safe and sound. I intended to settle in Tunisia because all my relatives live there. My parents too intend to go back home. The problem is that Muslim women are strictly forbidden to put on Hijab (veil) in Tunisia, even in the streets. All the members of my family living there were compelled to take off their Hijab (veil).
 
Moreover, it is not permissible there to hold any kind of religious meetings or gatherings even if they were a part of a wedding celebration or the like. Muslims there, especially the youth, are obliged to walk separately and are in continuous fear even when they observe the Salah (Prayer) at the mosque.
 
Consequently, living there is impossible for me and for my wife who wears Hijab (veil). With regard to my children, I can not guarantee that they will learn their religion on sound bases. Whenever I think about my current status, living in a country of non-Muslims, I feel so confused and undecided. I have no satisfactory solution because I do not know whether I should migrate in such conditions or not. Would you please tell me about some Hadiths and Qur'anic Ayahs (verses) upon which I can make the right decision, may Allah grant you all goodness. I fear lest I should later regret it or feel that I made the wrong decision.
 
Answer:

Dear brother, we thank you for your religious feeling which is the duty of every Muslim who believes in Allah as the Lord, Islam as a religion, and Muhammad (peace be upon him) as a Prophet. We recommend you to fear Allah, the Exalted, as He should be feared in all your matters. Moreover, we would like to tell you that residing in non-Muslim countries is forbidden in Islamic Shari'ah (Islamic law) except for a necessity acknowledged by Shari`ah (Islamic law). For example, seeking treatment which is not available in Muslim countries, to call to Islam and the like. You have to do your best and seek the means that make it easy for you to leave this non-Muslim country, and to move to a Muslim country even if it is not your home country. Allah, the Exalted, says, "And whosoever fears All√¢h and keeps his duty to Him, He will make a way for him to get out (from every difficulty). And He will provide him from (sources) he never could imagine." [at-Talaq: 2-3] 

If the status in France and Tunisia, is as you have mentioned, and it is not easy for you to migrate, you should fear Allah as He should be feared in regard to yourself, abide by and hold fast to your religion, observe the religious rituals such as the Five Obligatory Daily Prayers and others and seek refuge with Allah continuously to strengthen your heart. You also have to stay away from mingling and meeting with evil people. You should call to the path of Allah as much as you can. We ask Allah, the Benevolent, to grant you success and provide you with good wherever you are. Verily Allah is the One to be sought for achieving this and the only One Who is Able to do so.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
