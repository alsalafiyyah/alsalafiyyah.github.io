Question: 

Is it permissible for a Muslim to befriend, visit and study with a Christian friend?

Answer:

It is permissible for a Muslim to kindly treat Kafirs (disbelievers) who are not in a state of war with Islam, reciprocate their good treatment, as well as exchange beneficial things and presents with them. However, a Muslim must not befriend non-Muslims in a way that involves deep feelings of affection and support for them.

May Allah grant us success. May peace and blessings be upon our Prophet Muhammad, his family, and Companions.
